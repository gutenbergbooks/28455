<img src="images/img003.jpg" width="250" height="416" alt="Hercules." title="">
</div>

<p>One morning Jupiter boasted among the gods in Olympus that a son would
that day be born, in the line of Perseus, who would rule over all the
Argives. Juno was angry and jealous at this, and, as she was the
goddess who presided over the births of children, she contrived to
hinder the birth of the child he intended till that day was over, and
to hasten that of another grandson of the great Perseus. This child
was named Eurystheus, and, as he had been born on the right day,
Jupiter was forced to let him be King of Argos, Sparta, and Mycenæ,
and all the Dorian race; while the boy whom he had meant to be the
chief was kept in subjection, in spite of having wonderful gifts of
courage and strength, and a kind, generous nature, that always was
ready to help the weak and sorrowful.</p>

<p>His name was Alcides, or Hercules, and he was so strong at ten months
old that, with his own hands, he strangled two serpents whom Juno sent
to devour him in his cradle. He was bred up by Chiron, the chief of
the Centaurs, a wondrous race of beings, who had horses' bodies as far
as the forelegs, but where the neck of the horse would begin had human
breasts and shoulders, with arms and heads. Most of them were fierce
and savage; but Chiron was very wise and good, and, as Jupiter made
him immortal, he was the teacher of many of the great Greek heroes.
When Hercules was about eighteen, two maidens appeared to him&mdash;one in
a simple white dress, grave, modest, and seemly; the other scarcely
clothed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002"></a>(p. 002)</span> but tricked out in ornaments, with a flushed face,
and bold, roving eyes. The first told him that she was Virtue, and
that, if he would follow her, she would lead him through many hard
trials, but that he would be glorious at last, and be blest among the
gods. The other was Vice, and she tried to wile him by a smooth life
among wine-cups and dances and flowers and sports, all to be enjoyed
at once. But the choice of Hercules was Virtue, and it was well for
him, for Jupiter, to make up for Juno's cheat, had sworn that, if he
fulfilled twelve tasks which Eurystheus should put upon him, he should
be declared worthy of being raised to the gods at his death.</p>

<p>Eurystheus did not know that in giving these tasks he was making his
cousin fulfil his course; but he was afraid of such a mighty man, and
hoped that one of these would be the means of getting rid of him. So
when he saw Hercules at Argos, with a club made of a forest-tree in
his hand, and clad in the skin of a lion which he had slain,
Eurystheus bade him go and kill a far more terrible lion, of giant
brood, and with a skin that could not be pierced, which dwelt in the
valley of Nemea. The fight was a terrible one; the lion could not be
wounded, and Hercules was forced to grapple with it and strangle it in
his arms. He lost a finger in the struggle, but at last the beast died
in his grasp, and he carried it on his back to Argos, where Eurystheus
was so much frightened at the grim sight that he fled away to hide
himself, and commanded Hercules not to bring his monsters within the
gates of the city.</p>

<p>There was a second labor ready for Hercules&mdash;namely, the destroying a
serpent with nine heads, called Hydra, whose lair was the marsh of
Lerna. Hercules went to the battle, and managed to crush one head with
his club, but that moment two sprang up in its place; moreover, a huge
crab came out of the swamp and began to pinch his heels. Still he did
not lose heart, but, calling his friend Iolaus, he bade him take a
firebrand and burn the necks as fast as he cut off the heads; and thus
at last they killed the creature, and Hercules dipped his arrows in
its poisonous blood, so that their least wound became fatal.
Eurystheus said that it had not been a fair victory, since Hercules
had been helped, and Juno put the crab into the skies as the
constellation Cancer; while a labor to patience was next devised for
Hercules&mdash;namely, the chasing of the Arcadian stag, which was sacred
to Diana, and had golden horns and brazen hoofs. Hercules hunted it up
hill and down dale for a whole year, and when at last he caught it, he
got into trouble with Apollo and Diana about it, and had hard work to
appease them; but he did so at last; and for his fourth labor was sent
to catch alive a horrid wild boar on Mount Erymanthus. He followed the
beast through a deep swamp, caught it in a net, and brought it to
Mycenæ.</p>

<p>The fifth task was a curious one. Augeas, King of Elis, had immense
herds, and kept his stables and cowhouses in a frightful state of
filth, and Eurystheus, hoping either to disgust Hercules or kill him
by the unwholesomeness of the work, sent him to clean them. Hercules,
without telling Augeas it was his appointed task, offered to do it if
he were repaid the tenth of the herds, and received the promise on
oath. Then he dug a canal, and turned the water of two <span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003"></a>(p. 003)</span>
rivers into the stables, so as effectually to cleanse them; but when
Augeas heard it was his task, he tried to cheat him of the payment,
and on the other hand Eurystheus said, as he had been rewarded, it
could not count as one of his labors, and ordered him off to clear the
woods near Lake Stymphalis of some horrible birds, with brazen beaks
and claws, and ready-made arrows for feathers, which ate human flesh.
To get them to rise out of the forest was his first difficulty, but
Pallas lent him a brazen clapper, which made them take to their wings;
then he shot them with his poisoned arrows, killed many, and drove the
rest away.</p>

<p>King Minos, of Crete, had once vowed to sacrifice to the gods whatever
should appear from the sea. A beautiful white bull came, so fine that
it tempted him not to keep his word, and he was punished by the bull
going mad, and doing all sorts of damage in Crete; so that Eurystheus
thought it would serve as a labor for Hercules to bring the animal to
Mycenæ. In due time back came the hero, with the bull, quite subdued,
upon his shoulders; and, having shown it, he let it loose again to run
about Greece.</p>

<p>He had a harder task in getting the mares of the Thracian king,
Diomedes, which were fed on man's flesh. He overcame their grooms, and
drove the beasts away; but he was overtaken by Diomedes, and, while
fighting with him and his people, put the mares under the charge of a
friend; but when the battle was over, and Diomedes killed, he found
that they had eaten up their keeper. However, when he had fed them on
the dead body of their late master they grew mild and manageable, and
he brought them home.</p>

<p>The next expedition was against the Amazons, a nation of women
warriors, who lived somewhere on the banks of the Euxine, or Black
Sea, kept their husbands in subjection, and seldom brought up a son.
The bravest of all the Amazons was the queen, Hippolyta, to whom Mars
had given a belt as a reward for her valor. Eurystheus's daughter
wanted this belt, and Hercules was sent to fetch it. He was so hearty,
honest, and good-natured, that he talked over Hippolyta, and she
promised him her girdle; but Juno, to make mischief, took the form of
an Amazon, and persuaded the ladies that their queen was being deluded
and stolen away by a strange man, so they mounted their horses and
came down to rescue her. He thought she had been treacherous, and
there was a great fight, in which he killed her, and carried off her
girdle.</p>

<p>Far out in the west, near the ocean flowing found the world, were
herds of purple oxen, guarded by a two-headed dog, and belonging to a
giant with three bodies called Geryon, who lived in the isle of
Erythria, in the outmost ocean. Passing Lybia, Hercules came to the
end of the Mediterranean Sea, Neptune's domain, and there set up two
pillars&mdash;namely, Mounts Calpe and Abyla&mdash;on each side of the Straits
of Gibraltar. The rays of the sun scorched him, and in wrath he shot
at it with his arrows, when Helios, instead of being angry, admired
his boldness, and gave him his golden cup, wherewith to cross the
outer ocean, which he did safely, although old Oceanus, who was king
there, put up his hoary head, and tried to frighten him by shaking the
bowl. It was large enough to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span> hold all the herd of oxen, when
Hercules had killed dog, herdsman, and giant, and he returned it
safely to Helios when he had crossed the ocean.</p>

<p>Again Eurystheus sent Hercules to the utmost parts of the earth. This
time it was to bring home the golden apples which grew in the gardens
of the Hesperides, the daughters of old Atlas, who dwelt in the land
of Hesperus, the Evening Star, and, together with a dragon, guarded
the golden tree in a beautiful garden. Hercules made a long journey,
apparently round by the north, and on his way had to wrestle with a
dreadful giant named Antæus. Though thrown down over and over again,
Antæus rose up twice as strong every time, till Hercules found out
that he grew in force whenever he touched his mother earth, and
therefore, lifting him up in those mightiest of arms, the hero
squeezed the breath out of him. By and by he came to Mount Caucasus,
where he found the chained Prometheus, and, aiming an arrow at the
eagle, killed the tormentor, and set the Titan free. Atlas undertook
to go to his daughters, and get the apples, if Hercules would hold up
the skies for him in the meantime. Hercules agreed, and Atlas shifted
the heavens to his shoulders, went, and presently returned with three
apples of gold, but said he would take them to Eurystheus, and
Hercules must continue to bear the load of the skies. Prometheus bade
Hercules say he could not hold them without a pad for them to rest on
upon his head. Atlas took them again to hold while the pad was put on;
and thereupon Hercules picked up the apples, and left the old giant to
his load.</p>

<p>One more labor remained&mdash;namely, to bring up the three-headed
watch-dog, Cerberus, from the doors of Tartarus. Mercury and Pallas
both came to attend him, and led him alive among the shades, who all
fled from him, except Medusa and one brave youth. He gave them the
blood of an ox to drink, and made his way to Pluto's throne, where he
asked leave to take Cerberus to the upper world with him. Pluto said
he might, if he could overcome Cerberus without weapons; and this he
did, struggling with the dog, with no protection but the lion's skin,
and dragging him up to the light, where the foam that fell from the
jaws of one of the three mouths produced the plant called aconite, or
hellebore, which is dark and poisonous. After showing the beast to
Eurystheus, Hercules safely returned him to the under world, and thus
completed his twelve great labors.</p>

<p>Hercules was subject to fits of madness, in one of which he slew a
friend, and as a penalty he allowed himself to be sold as a slave. He
was purchased by the Queen of Lydia, Omphale, and remained in her
service three years. She used to make him do a woman's work, and even
dressed him at times in female garments, while she herself wore his
famous lion skin and laughed at him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img004.jpg" width="600" height="423" alt="" title="">
<p>Hercules at the Feet of Omphale.</p></div>

<p>But strong as he was, Hercules had in time to meet death himself. He
had married a nymph named Deianira, and was taking her home, when he
came to a river where a Centaur named Nessus lived, and gained his
bread by carrying travellers over on his back. Hercules paid him the
price for carrying Deianira over, while he himself crossed on foot;
but as soon as the river was between them, the faithless Centaur began
to gallop away with the lady. Hercules sent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span> an arrow after
him, which brought him to the ground, and as he was dying he prepared
his revenge by telling Deianira that his blood was enchanted with love
for her, and that if ever she found her husband's affection failing
her, she had only to make him put on a garment anointed with it, and
his heart would return to her; he knew full well that his blood was
full of the poison of the Hydra, but poor Deianira believed him, and
had saved some of the blood before Hercules came up.</p>

<p>Several years after, Hercules made prisoner a maiden named Iole, in
Lydia, after gaining a great victory. Landing in the island of
Eub&oelig;a, he was going to make a great sacrifice to Jupiter, and sent
home to Deianira for a festal garment to wear at it. She was afraid he
was falling in love with Iole, and steeped the garment in the
preparation she had made from Nessus's blood. No sooner did Hercules
put it on, than his veins were filled with agony, which nothing could
assuage. He tried to tear off the robe, but the skin and flesh came
with it, and his blood was poisoned beyond relief. Unable to bear the
pain any longer, and knowing that by his twelve tasks he had earned
the prize of endless life, he went to Mount &OElig;ta, crying aloud with
the pain, so that the rocks rang again with the sound. He gave his
quiver of arrows to his friend Philoctetes, charging him to collect
his ashes and bury them, but never to make known the spot; and then he
tore up, with his mighty strength, trees by the roots, enough to form
a funeral pile, lay down on it, and called on his friend to set fire
to it; but no one could bear to do so, till a shepherd consented to
thrust in a torch. Then thunder was heard, a cloud came down, and he
was borne away to Olympus, while Philoctetes collected and buried the
ashes.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>THESEUS</h3>

<a id="img005" name="img005"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img005.jpg" width="200" height="317" alt="Theseus." title="">
</div>

<p>Theseus, the great national hero of Athens, is said to have been born
at Tr&oelig;zen, where his father, Ægeus, King of Athens, slept one night
with Æthra, the daughter of Pittheus, king of the place. Ægeus, on his
departure, hid his sword and his shoes under a large stone, and
charged Æthra, if she brought forth a son, to send him to Athens with
these tokens, as soon as he was able to roll away the stone. She
brought forth a son, to whom she gave the name of Theseus, and when he
was grown up informed him of his origin, and told him to take up the
tokens and sail to Athens, for the roads were infested by robbers and
monsters. But Theseus, who was desirous of emulating the glory of
Hercules, refused to go by sea, and after destroying various monsters
who had been the terror of the country, arrived in safety at Athens.
Here he was joyfully recognized by Ægeus, but with difficulty escaped
destruction from Media and the Pallantids, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> the sons and
grandsons of Pallas, the brother of Ægeus. These dangers, however, he
finally surmounted, and slew the Pallantids in battle.</p>

<p>His next exploit was the destruction of the great Marathonian bull,
which ravaged the neighboring country; and shortly after he resolved
to deliver the Athenians from the tribute that they were obliged to
pay to Minos, King of Crete. Every ninth year the Athenians had to
send seven young men and as many virgins to Crete, to be devoured by
the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. Theseus volunteered to go as one of the
victims, and through the assistance of Ariadne, the daughter of Minos,
who became enamoured of him, he slew the Minotaur and escaped from the
Labyrinth. He then sailed away with Ariadne, whom he deserted in the
island of Dia or Naxos, an event which frequently forms the subject of
ancient works of art. The sails of the ship Theseus left Athens in
were black, but he promised his father, if he returned in safety, to
hoist white sails. This, however, he neglected to do, and Ægeus,
seeing the ship draw near with black sails, supposed that his son had
perished, and threw himself from a rock.</p>

<p>Theseus now ascended the throne of Athens. But his adventures were by
no means concluded. He marched into the country of the Amazons, who
dwelt on the Thermodon, according to some accounts, in the company of
Hercules, and carried away their queen, Antiope. The Amazons in
revenge invaded Attica, and were with difficulty defeated by the
Athenians. This battle was one of the favorite subjects of the ancient
artists, and is commemorated in several works of art that are still
extant. Theseus also took part in the Argonautic expedition and the
Calydonian hunt. He assisted his friend Pirithous and the Lapithæ in
their contest with the Centaurs, and also accompanied the former in
his descent to the lower world to carry off Proserpine, the wife of
Pluto. When Theseus was fifty years old, according to tradition, he
carried off Helen, the daughter of Leda, who was then only nine years
of age. But his territory was invaded in consequence by Castor and
Pollux, the brothers of Leda; his own people rose against him, and at
last, finding his affairs desperate, he withdrew to the island of
Scyros, and there perished, either by a fall from the cliffs or
through the treachery of Lycomedes, the king of the island. For a long
time his memory was forgotten by the Athenians, but he was
subsequently honored by them as the greatest of their heroes. At the
battle of Marathon they thought they saw him armed and bearing down
upon the barbarians, and after the conclusion of the Persian war his
bones were discovered at Scyros by Cimon, who conveyed them to Athens
where they were received with great pomp and deposited in a temple
built to his honor. A festival also was instituted, which was
celebrated on the eighth day of every month, but more especially on
the eighth of Pyanipsion.</p>

<p>The above is a brief account of the legends prevailing respecting
Theseus. But he is, moreover, represented by ancient writers as the
founder of the Attic commonwealth, and even of its democratic
institutions. It would be waste of time to inquire whether there was
an historical personage of this name who actually introduced the
political changes ascribed to him; it will be convenient to adhere to
the ancient account in describing them as the work of Theseus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img006.jpg" width="600" height="383" alt="" title="">
<p>Tribute to the Minotaur.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span> Before this time Attica contained many independent townships,
which were only nominally united. Theseus incorporated the people into
one state, removed the principal courts for the administration of
justice to Athens, and greatly enlarged the city, which had hitherto
covered little more than the rock which afterward formed the citadel.
To cement their union he instituted several festivals, and especially
changed the Athenæa into the Panathenæa, or the festivals of all the
Atticans. He encouraged the nobles to reside at Athens, and
surrendered a part of his kingly prerogatives to them; for which
reason he is perhaps represented as the founder of the Athenian
democracy, although the government which he established was, and
continued to be long after him, strictly aristocratic.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>ULYSSES<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" title="Go to footnote 1"><span class="small">[1]</span></a><br>

<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img007.jpg" width="300" height="192" alt="Ulysses." title="">
</div>

<p>While courage and strength seemed to the ancient Greeks the noblest of
virtues, they ranked wisdom and ready wit almost as high. Achilles was
the strongest of the Grecian warriors at the siege of Troy, but there
was another almost as strong, equally brave, and far shrewder of wit.
This was Ulysses. It was he who ultimately brought about the capture
of the city. Homer speaks often of him in his "Iliad;" and the bard's
second great work, the "Odyssey," is devoted entirely to the
wanderings of Odysseus, or, as we have learned from the Romans to call
him, Ulysses. Whether he was a real person or only a creation of the
poet's fancy, it is impossible to say. But as it is now generally
agreed that there was a siege of Troy, it follows that there was
probably a Ulysses, and his adventures, while in the main mythical,
are of value as having perhaps some foundation in truth, and giving,
at all events, a picture of what the old Greeks thought a hero should
be and do.</p>

<p>Ulysses was King of Ithaca when he was summoned to join the rest of
the Grecian princes for the war with Troy. He had no wish to go, for
he had lately married a beautiful girl, Penelope, and was happy as a
man might be. So when the heralds came he pretended to be insane, and
hitching a yoke of oxen to a plough he drove them along the sands of
the sea-shore. He sang and shouted, and ploughed up the sand, and
scattered salt as if he were sowing it, and cried out that he would
soon have a beautiful crop of salt waves. The heralds watched him for
a moment, and then returning to the princes told them that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span>
there was no use delivering the summons to Ulysses, for he had lost
his wits. Then Palamedes, who, after Ulysses, was accounted shrewdest
of the Greeks, went, and standing there on the beach, watched the
plough. And he took Ulysses's baby son and threw him in front of the
team to see if the father was indeed mad. Ulysses turned the plough
aside to avoid the child; and then the princes knew it was all a
pretence, and he had to go with them. But he never forgave Palamedes,
and long after brought about his death.</p>

<p>He was in many ways the ablest of the Greeks. Next to Achilles, Ajax
was accounted the strongest; but Ulysses threw him in wrestling.
Oilemenus was regarded as the swiftest of men, but Ulysses in a race
outran him. When Achilles was slain Ulysses alone held back all the
Trojans, while his comrades bore the body to their ships. Many other
great exploits he performed, and his counsels were of much value to
the Greeks through all the long siege. A great pile of spoils was
heaped up to be given to the man who had been of most use to the
assailants, and the Trojan prisoners themselves being called on to
decide, gave it to Ulysses. At the last, when Achilles was dead, and
the Greeks were all worn out and despairing, it was his fertile brain
which originated the snare into which the Trojans fell.</p>

<p>Now, with the other Greeks, Ulysses set out to return to his home. Yet
first he stopped with his Ithacans to attack the Trojan city of
Ciconia. The assault was unexpected and successful. Great treasure
fell into the hands of the conquerors; but, in spite of their leader's
entreaties, they persisted in stopping in the captured city for a
night's carouse. The dispersed Ciconians rallied, gathered together
their allies, and attacking the revellers, defeated them with great
slaughter, so that less than half of them escaped in their ships. Yet
this was only the first of the many mishaps which befell the
ill-starred Ulysses. So persistently did misfortune pursue him that
the superstitious Greeks declared that he must have incurred the
hatred of the sea-god, Neptune, who would not let him cross his
domains.</p>

<p>No sooner had his flying ships escaped from Ciconia than they were
struck by a terrific tempest which drove them far out of their course.
For three days the storm continued; then, as it abated, they saw
before them an unknown shore on which they landed to rest and recover
their strength. It was the land of the lotos-eaters, and when Ulysses
sent messengers to find out where he was, they, too, ate of the lotos
fruit. It caused them to forget everything; their struggles and
exhaustion, their homes, their leader, the great battles they had
fought, all were obliterated. They only cared to lie there as the
other lotos-eaters did, doing no work, but just dreaming all their
lives, nibbling at the fruit, which was both food and drink, until
they grew old and died.</p>

<p>Ulysses knew that any life, no matter how wretched, was far better
than this death in life. He forbade any other of his men to touch the
fruit, and binding those who had already eaten it, he bore them,
despite their pleading and weeping, back to his ships, which he at
once led away from that clime of subtle danger. They next sighted a
fertile island, where leaving most of his comrades <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> for the
rest they needed, Ulysses sailed in his own ship, exploring. He soon
found himself in a beautiful country, where were seen vast herds of
sheep and goats, but no people. Landing with his men, they explored it
and found great caves full of milk and cheese, but still no people,
only a huge giant in the distance. So sitting down in one of the caves
they feasted merrily and awaited the return of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Now these inhabitants were giants, such as the one they had seen. They
were called Cyclops, and had only one great eye in the middle of the
forehead. The Cyclops who owned the cave in which the adventurers were
was a particularly large and savage one named Polyphemus. When he
returned at night and saw the men within, he immediately seized two of
them, cracked their heads together, and ate them for supper. Then he
went to bed. Ulysses and his terrified men would have slain the huge
creature as he slept; but he had rolled a great stone in front of the
door, and they could not possibly move it to escape. In the morning
the monster ate two more of the unfortunates and then went off with
his flocks, fastening the door as before. In the evening he ate two
more.</p>

<p>By this time the crafty Ulysses, as Homer delights to call him, had
perfected his plans. He offered Polyphemus some wine, which so
delighted him that he asked the giver his name, and said he had it in
mind to do him a kindness. The crafty one told him his name was
No-man. Then said the ogre, "This shall be your reward, I will eat
No-man the last of you all." Then, heavy with the wine, he fell into a
deep sleep. The tiny weapons of the wanderers would have been of
little effect against this man-mountain, so taking a great pole, they
heated it red-hot in the fire, and all together plunged it into his
one great eye, blinding him. Up he jumped, roaring and howling
horribly, and groping in the dark to find his prisoners; but they
easily avoided him. Then came other Cyclops running at the noise from
their distant caves, and called to him, "Who has hurt thee,
Polyphemus?"</p>

<p>He answered them, "No-man has hurt me, No-man has blinded me."</p>

<p>Then they said, "If no man has hurt thee, thy trouble is from the
gods, and we may not interfere. Bear it patiently, and pray to them."</p>

<p>In the morning Polyphemus opened the door, and sitting in it, let his
sheep pass out, feeling each one, so that the Greeks might not escape.
But the crafty one fastened himself and his remaining comrades under
the breasts of the largest sheep, and so, hidden by the wool, escaped
unnoticed. They hurried to their ship and put out to sea. And now
feeling safe, Ulysses shouted to the blind monster and taunted him,
whereon, rushing to the shore, Polyphemus lifted up a vast rock and
hurled it toward the sound he heard. It almost struck the vessel, and
its waves swept the little craft back to the land. In great haste they
shoved off again, and when they felt safe, shouted at him once more.
He followed them, hurling rocks, but now they were beyond his reach
and returned safely to their companions.</p>

<p>Next the wanderers reached the island of Æolus, who controls the
winds. He received them with royal hospitality, pointed out to them
their proper course to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> Ithaca, and when they left him, gave
to Ulysses a bag in which he had tied up all the contrary winds, that
they might have a fair one to waft them home. For nine days they
sailed, and at last were actually in sight of their destination; but
the seamen fancying there was treasure in Æolus's bag opened it while
their leader slept. At once leaped out all the wild winds, and there
was a terrible tempest which swept the vessels back to their
starting-point. Æolus, however, refused to help them again, for he
said they were plainly accursed of the gods.</p>

<p>So they journeyed on as best they might, and came to the land of the
Læstrygonians. These people were of enormous strength and were
cannibals; but Ulysses and his men knowing nothing of this, sailed
into the narrow harbor. As they landed the cannibals rushed upon them
and slew them, and hurling rocks from the top of the narrow entrance,
sank those ships which would have escaped. Ulysses in his own ship
managed to force his way out, but all the other ships were taken and
their crews slain.</p>

<p>Then, in deep mourning, Ulysses sailed on till he came to the home of
Circe, a beautiful but wicked enchantress. Here he divided his crew
into two parties, and while one half rested, the others went to find
what place this was. Circe welcomed them in her palace, feasted them,
and gave them a magic drink. When they had drunk this, she touched
them with her wand, and they were turned into swine, all except one,
who had feared to enter the palace, and now returning, told Ulysses
that the others had disappeared. Then the hero arose and went alone to
the palace; but on the way he sought out a little herb which might
render the drink harmless. This he ate, and when Circe having given
him the deadly cup, would have turned him also into a brute, he drew
his sword as if to slay her. Terribly frightened, she besought mercy,
and at his request restored his men to their own forms.</p>

<p>Directed by her, Ulysses is said to have entered the abode of the
dead, and conversed with the ghosts of all the great warriors who had
been slain in the Trojan war, or who had died since. At last, when
Circe had no more wonders to show him, the wanderer left her, once
more directed on the road to Ithaca, and to some extent warned of the
dangers which beset the path.</p>

<p>First he had to pass the Sirens, beautiful but baleful maidens, who
sat on a rocky shore and sang a magic song so alluring, that men
hearing it let their ships drift on the rocks while listening, or
threw themselves into the sea to swim to the maidens, and were
drowned. No man had ever heard them and lived. Here the crafty one
filled his companions' ears with wax, so they could not hear the
Sirens' song, and he bade them bind him to the mast, so that he might
hear it but could not go to them. This was done, and they passed in
safety. Ulysses heard the sweet song, and raved and struggled to break
his bonds, but they held fast. So he was the first to hear the Sirens'
song and live. And some say he was the last as well, for in despair,
thinking their music had lost its power, the maidens threw themselves
into the sea.</p>

<img src="images/img008.jpg" width="600" height="378" alt="Ulysses." title="">
<p>Ulysses defying the Cyclops.</p></div>

<p>Next the wanderers came to a narrow strait, on one side of which was
Charybdis, a dread whirlpool from which no ship could escape, and on
the other <span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span> was the cave of Scylla, a monster having six
snake-like heads, with each of which she seized a man from every
passing ship. Choosing the lesser evil, the bold Ulysses sailed
through the strait close to Scylla; and six poor wretches were
snatched by the monster from the deck and devoured, but the rest
escaped.</p>

<span class="add1em">Agamemnon.</span></p></div>

<p>Then they came to an uninhabited island, filled with herds of cattle.
These were held sacred to the sun, and no man might slay or eat them
without being punished by the gods. This Ulysses knew well, and warned
his men against touching them; but great tempests now swelled up, and
for a whole month the sailors could not leave the island. Their
provisions gave out and they were starving. Then their leader wandered
away looking for help, and while he was gone they slew some of the
oxen and ate their fill. The storm died, and, Ulysses returning, they
again set sail; but at once came a terrific hurricane, upset the ship,
and drowned all of the guilty ones. Ulysses had not eaten the flesh of
the oxen; and he alone was saved, clinging to a spar, and was tossed
on the island of the nymph Calypso. After a long sojourn he escaped
from here on a raft. But his old enemy Neptune again raised a storm,
which broke his raft; and, naked and almost dead, he was thrown upon
another shore, from which at last the pitying people sent him home. He
had been away twenty years.</p>

<p>His fair wife Penelope had been for four years past pestered with
suitors, who declared that Ulysses must be dead. She put them all off,
by saying that first she must finish a wonderful cloth she was
weaving; and on this she undid each night what she had done in the
day. Meanwhile they stayed in the palace, haughty and insolent,
terrifying everybody, in defiance of the protests of Ulysses' infant
son, now grown to be almost a man.</p>

<p>The wanderer, coming alone and finding how things were, feared they
would slay him; so, disguised as an old beggar man, he went to the
palace. The suitors mocked him, and then in sport it was proposed to
see who could bend the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span> great Ulysses's bow. It was brought
out, but none could bend it. The beggar asked leave to try, and they
hesitated, but gave him leave. Right easily he bent it, and sent then
a broad arrow through the leader of the suitors. Ulysses's son ranged
himself by his side. Some old servants, recognizing him, did the same;
and soon all those parasites were slain. Then was there a royal
welcome from wife and son, and afterward from kinsmen and friends and
servants, for the royal wanderer, whom the gods had spared, and who at
last was returned home.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>Among the Trojans at the fall of Troy there was a prince called Æneas,
whose father was Anchises, a cousin of Priam, and whose mother was
said to be the goddess Venus. When he saw that the city was lost he
rushed back to his house and took his old father Anchises on his back,
giving him his penates, or little images of household gods, to take
care of, and led by the hand his little son Iulus, or Ascanius, while
his wife Creusa followed close behind, and all the Trojans who could
get their arms together joined him, so that they escaped in a body to
Mount Ida; but just as they were outside the city he missed poor
Creusa, and though he rushed back and searched for her everywhere, he
never could find her. Because of his care for his gods, and for his
old father, he is always known as the pious Æneas.</p>

<p>In the forests of Mount Ida he built ships enough to set forth with
all his followers in quest of the new home which his mother, the
goddess Venus, gave him hopes of. He had adventures rather like those
of Ulysses as he sailed about the Mediterranean. Once in the
Strophades, some clusters belonging to the Ionian Islands, where he
and his troops had landed to get food, and were eating the flesh of
the numerous goats which they found climbing about the rocks, down on
them came the harpies, horrible birds with women's faces and hooked
hands, with which they snatched away the food and spoiled what they
could not eat. The Trojans shot at them, but the arrows glanced off
their feathers and did not hurt them. However, they all flew off
except one, who sat on a high rock, and croaked out that the Trojans
would be punished for thus molesting the harpies, by being tossed
about till they should reach Italy, but there they should not build
their city till they should have been so hungry as to eat their very
trenchers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span> They sailed away from this dismal prophetess, and touched on
the coast of Epirus, where Æneas found his cousin Helenus, son to old
Priam, reigning over a little new Troy, and married to Andromache,
Hector's wife, whom he had gained after Pyrrhus had been killed.
Helenus was a prophet, and he gave Æneas much advice. In especial he
said that when the Trojans should come to Italy they would find, under
the holly-trees by the river-side, a large, white, old sow lying on
the ground, with a litter of thirty little pigs round her, and this
should be a sign to them where they were to build their city.</p>

<p>By his advice the Trojans coasted round the south of Sicily, instead
of trying to pass the strait between the dreadful Scylla and
Charybdis, and just below Mount Etna an unfortunate man came running
down to the beach begging to be taken in. He was a Greek, who had been
left behind when Ulysses escaped from Polyphemus's cave, and had made
his way to the forests, where he had lived ever since. They had just
taken him in when they saw the Cyclop coming down, with a pine-tree
for a staff, to wash the burning hollow of his lost eye in the sea,
and they rowed off in great terror.</p>

<p>Poor old Anchises died shortly after, and while his son was still
sorrowing for him, Juno, who hated every Trojan, stirred up a terrible
tempest, which drove the ships to the south, until, just as the sea
began to calm down, they came into a beautiful bay, enclosed by tall
cliffs with woods overhanging them. Here the tired wanderers landed,
and, lighting a fire, Æneas went in quest of food. Coming out of the
forest they looked down from a hill, and beheld a multitude of people
building a city, raising walls, houses, towers, and temples. Into one
of these temples Æneas entered, and to his amazement he found the
walls sculptured with all the story of the siege of Troy, and all his
friends so perfectly represented, that he burst into tears at the
sight.</p>

<p>Just then a beautiful queen, attended by a whole troop of nymphs, came
into the temple. This lady was Dido; her husband, Sichæus, had been
King of Tyre, till he was murdered by his brother, Pygmalion, who
meant to have married her; but she fled from him with a band of
faithful Tyrians and all her husband's treasure, and had landed on the
north coast of Africa. There she begged of the chief of the country as
much land as could be enclosed by a bullock's hide. He granted this
readily; and Dido, cutting the hide into the finest possible strips,
managed to measure off ground enough to build the splendid city which
she had named Carthage. She received Æneas most kindly, and took all
his men into her city, hoping to keep them there forever, and make him
her husband. Æneas himself was so happy there that he forgot all his
plans and the prophecies he had heard, until Jupiter sent Mercury to
rouse him to fulfil his destiny. He obeyed the call; and Dido was so
wretched at his departure that she caused a great funeral pile to be
built, laid herself on the top, and stabbed herself with Æneas's
sword; the pile was burnt, and the Trojans saw the flame from their
ships without knowing the cause.</p>

<p>By and by Æneas landed at a place in Italy named Cumæ. There dwelt one
of the Sibyls. These were wondrous virgins whom Apollo had endowed
with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> deep wisdom; and when Æneas went to consult the Cumæan
Sibyl, she told him that he must visit the under-world of Pluto to
learn his fate. First, however, he had to go into a forest, and find
there and gather a golden bough, which he was to bear in his hand to
keep him safe. Long he sought it, until two doves, his mother's birds,
came flying before him to show him the tree where gold gleamed through
the boughs, and he found the branch growing on the tree as mistletoe
grows on the thorn.</p>

<p>Guarded with this, and guided by the Sibyl, after a great sacrifice,
Æneas passed into a gloomy cave, where he came to the river Styx,
round which flitted all the shades who had never received funeral
rites, and whom the ferryman, Charon, would not carry over. The Sibyl,
however, made him take Æneas across, his boat groaning under the
weight of a human body. On the other side stood Cerberus, but the
Sibyl threw him a cake of honey and of some opiate, and he lay asleep,
while Æneas passed on and found in myrtle groves all who had died for
love&mdash;among them, to his surprise, poor forsaken Dido. A little
farther on he found the home of the warriors, and held converse with
his old Trojan friends. He passed by the place of doom for the wicked,
Tartarus; and in the Elysian Fields, full of laurel groves and meads
of asphodel, he found the spirit of his father Anchises, and with him
was allowed to see the souls of all their descendants, as yet unborn,
who should raise the glory of their name. They are described on to the
very time when the poet wrote to whom we owe all the tale of the
wanderings of Æneas, namely, Virgil, who wrote the "Æneid," whence all
these stories are taken. He further tells us that Æneas landed in
Italy, just as his old nurse Caiëta died, at the place which still is
called Gaëta. After they had buried her they found a grove, where they
sat down on the grass to eat, using large round cakes or biscuits to
put their meat on. Presently they came to eating up the cakes. Little
Ascanius cried out, "We are eating our very tables," and Æneas,
remembering the harpy's words, knew that his wanderings were over.</p>

<p>Virgil goes on to tell at much length how the king of the country,
Latinus, at first made friends with Æneas, and promised him his
daughter Lavinia in marriage; but Turnus, an Italian chief who had
before been a suitor to Lavinia, stirred up a great war, and was only
conquered and killed after much hard fighting. However, the white sow
was found in the right place with all her little pigs, and on the spot
was founded the city of Alba Longa, where Æneas and Lavinia reigned
until he died, and his descendants, through his two sons, Ascanius or
Iulus, and Æneas Silvius, reigned after him for fifteen generations.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>There is no figure in Greek history more familiar to us than this
famous Athenian. There are passages in his life known to every
schoolboy; we possess all the books he ever wrote; we know therefore
his opinions upon all the important questions of life, religion,
ethics, politics, manners, education, as well as upon finance and
military tactics, not to speak of social intercourse and sport. And
yet his early youth and late age are hidden from us. Like the models
of Greek eloquence, which begin with tame obviousness, rise into
dignity, fire, pathos, and then close softly, without sounding
peroration, so Xenophon comes upon us, an educated young man, looking
out for something to do; we lose him in the autumn of his life, when
he was driven from the fair retreat which the old man had hoped would
be his final resting-place. During seven years of his early manhood we
find him in the middle of all the most stirring events in the Greek
world. For thirty years later (394-62 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), we hear him from his
retired country-seat recording contemporary history, telling the
adventures of his youth, from the fascinations of the ragged Socrates
to the fascinations of the magnificent Cyrus, preaching the lessons of
his varied life. Then came the bitter loss of his brave son, killed in
the van at Mantinea. According to good authority he only survived this
blow a couple of years. But even then he appears to have found
distraction from his grief by a dry tract upon the Attic revenue. Such
is the general outline which we shall fill up and color from allusions
throughout his varied and manifold writings.</p>

<p>He was a pure Athenian, evidently of aristocratic birth, and
attracted, probably by his personal beauty, the attention of Socrates,
who is said to have stopped him in the way, and asked him did he know
where men of honor were to be found; upon his replying <i>no</i>, the sage
said, follow me and learn. This apocryphal anecdote, at all events,
records the fact that Xenophon attached himself to Socrates's
teaching, and so afforded us perhaps the most remarkable instance of
the great and various influence of that great teacher. We do not
wonder at disciples like Plato; but here is a young man of fashion, of
a practical turn, and loving adventure, who records in after years the
teaching after his own <span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span> fashion, and in a perfectly
independent way, as the noblest of training. His youth, however, was
spent in the distressful later years of the Peloponnesian War, which
ended in fearful gloom and disaster for his native city. Intimate,
apparently, with the great historian Thucydides, whose unfinished work
he seems to have edited, and subsequently to have continued in his own
"Hellenica," he must have long foreseen the collapse of the Athenian
empire, and then he and many other adventurous spirits found
themselves in a society faded in prosperity, with no scope for energy
or enterprise. Such was the somewhat tame and vulgar Athens which
succeeded to that of Pericles and Aristophanes, and which could not
tolerate the spiritual boldness of Socrates. He tells us himself, in
the third book of his "Anabasis," how he was tempted to leave Athens
for the East by his friend Proxenus, who had made the acquaintance of
the chivalrous and ambitious Cyrus, brother of the Persian king, and
governor of southern Asia Minor. This prince was preparing secretly to
invade Persia and dethrone his brother, and for that purpose was
gathering troops and courting the favor of the Greeks. His splendid
gifts were on a scale sufficient to dazzle men of small means and
smaller prospects, like the youth of conquered Athens. Xenophon
thought it right to consult his spiritual guide, Socrates, on the
propriety of abandoning his country for hireling service. The
philosopher advised him to consult the oracle at Delphi, but the young
man only asked what gods he might best conciliate before his
departure, and Socrates, though noting the evasion of his advice,
acquiesced.</p>

<p>When Xenophon arrived at Sardis, Proxenus presented him to Cyrus, who
invited him to accompany him on his pretended campaign to Pisidia, and
then coaxed him on with the rest into his enterprise against the king
Artaxerxes. On this expedition or <i>anabasis</i> up the country, Xenophon
was only a volunteer, with no command, and under no man's orders, but
accompanying the army on horseback, and enjoying the trip as a bright
young man, well appointed by the prince, and full of intelligent
curiosity, was sure to enjoy it. But then came the decisive day of
Cunaxa, where Xenophon offered his services as an extra aide-de-camp
to Cyrus, and where he witnessed the victory of his countrymen and the
defeat of their cause by the rashness and death of Cyrus. In the
crisis which followed he took no leading part, till the generals of
the 10,000 Greeks were entrapped and murdered by Tissaphernes. Then,
in the midst of the panic and despair which supervened, he tells us in
graphic words how he came to be a leader of men. He, too, with the
rest, was in sore distress, and could not sleep; but anon getting a
snatch of rest he had a dream. It seemed to him that there was a
storm, and a thunderbolt fell on his father's house and set it all in
a blaze. He sprang up in terror, and, pondering the matter, decided
that in part the dream was good, in that when in great danger he had
seen a light from Zeus; but partly, too, he feared it, for it came
from the king of heaven. But as soon as he was fully awake the first
clear thought that came into his head was: "Why am I lying here? The
night advances, and with the coming day the enemy will be upon us. If
we fall into the king's hands we must face torture, slavery, and
death, and yet here we lie, as if it were a time for rest! What am I
waiting for? Is it a general <span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span> to lead me? and where is he? or
till I am myself of riper age to command? Older I shall never be, if
to-day I surrender to mine enemies." And so he rouses the officers of
his murdered friend, Proxenos, and appeals to them all to be up and
stirring, to organize their defence and appoint new leaders to direct
them. Before dawn he has some kind of confidence restored, and the new
organization in progress. Presently the Persians send to demand the
surrender of the army whose generals they had seized, and find to
their astonishment that their task of subduing the Greeks must begin
afresh. Meanwhile the policy of the Greek army becomes defined. They
threaten to settle in Mesopotamia and build a fortified city which
shall be a great danger and a torment to the king. They really desire
to escape to the coast, if they can but find the way.</p>

<p>It was the king's policy to let them depart, but so harass them by the
way as to produce disorder and rout, which meant absolute destruction.
It was in conducting this retreat, as a joint general with the Spartan
Cheirisophos, that Xenophon showed all his resource. There were no
great pitched battles; no room for strategy or large combinations; but
ample scope for resource in the details of tactics for meeting new and
sudden difficulties, for maintaining order among an army of men that
only acknowledged leaders for their ability. At first, in the plains,
as they journeyed northward, the danger was from the Persian cavalry,
for their own contingent had deserted to the enemy. This difficulty,
which well-nigh ruined the 10,000, as it ruined Crassus in his retreat
at Carrhæ, he met by organizing a corps of Rhodian slingers and
archers, whose range was longer than that of the Persians, and who
thus kept the cavalry in check. When the plains were passed, and the
mountains reached, there arose the new difficulties of forcing passes,
of repelling wild mountaineers from positions commanding the road, of
providing food, and avoiding false routes. The narrative of the
surmounting of all these obstacles with tact and temper is the main
subject of the famous "Anabasis." Still graver dangers awaited
Xenophon when the retreating army had at last hailed the welcome
sea&mdash;the Black Sea&mdash;and with returning safety returned jealousies,
insubordinations, and the great problem what to do with this great
army when it arrived at Greek cities. Xenophon had always dreamt of
forming on the border of Hellenedom a new city state, which should
honor him as its founder. The wilder spirits thought it simpler to
loot some rich city like Byzantium, which was saved with difficulty
from their lawlessness. The Spartan governors, who now ruled
throughout the Greek world, saw the danger, and were determined to
delay and worry the dangerous horde until it dissipated; and they
succeeded so well that presently the 6,000 that remained were glad to
be led by Xenophon to take service under the Spartan commander Thibron
in Asia Minor (399 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>). But Xenophon was not given any independent
command. He appears to have acted on the staff of the successive
Spartan commanders till with King Agesilaus he attained personal
influence, and probably planned the new expedition of that king to
conquer Persia, which was only balked by a diversion wrought by
Persian gold in Greece. With Agesilaus Xenophon returned therefore to
Greece, and was present at the great shock of the rival infantries,
the Theban and the Spartan, at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span> Coronea (394 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>). But
either his presence in the Spartan army, or his former action against
the King of Persia, whom shifting politics were now bringing over to
the Athenian side, caused him to be sentenced to banishment at Athens,
and so made his return to his native city impossible. He went,
therefore, with his royal patron to Sparta, and sojourned there for
some time, even sending for his sons, now growing boys, from Miletus,
and submitting them, at Agesilaus's advice, to the famous Spartan
education. They grew up fine and warlike young men, so that the death
of one of them, Gryllus, in a cavalry skirmish just before the great
battle of Mantinea (362 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) caused universal regret. But long before
this catastrophe the Spartans gave Xenophon possession of an estate at
Skillus, near the famous Olympia, which combined the pleasures of
seclusion and of field sports with those of varied society when the
stream of visitors assembled for the Olympic games (every four years).
He himself tells us that he and his family, in company with their
neighbors, had excellent sport of all kinds. He was not only a careful
farmer, but so keen at hunting hares that he declares a man at this
delightful pursuit "will forget that he ever cared for anything else."
He had also built a shrine to his patroness, the goddess Artemis, and
the solemn sacrifices at her shrine were the occasion of feasts, whose
solemnity only enhanced their enjoyments. As Mr. Dakyns writes: "The
lovely scenery of the place, to this day lovely; the delicious
atmosphere; the rare combination of mountain, wood, and stream; the
opportunity for sport; the horses and the dogs; the household, the
farmstead, and their varying occupations; the neighboring country
gentlemen, and the local politics; the recurring festival at Olympia
with its stream of visitors; the pleasures of hospitable
entertainment; the constant sacrifices before the cedar image of
Artemis in her temple&mdash;these things, and above all the serene
satisfaction of successful literary labors, combined to form an
enviable sum total of sober happiness during many years." There can be
no doubt that this was the first great period of his literary
activity, though he may have edited, in early youth, his predecessor
Thucydides, and composed the first two books of his historical
continuation entitled "Hellenica." In his retreat at Skillus he
composed a series of "Dialogues," in what is termed the Socratic vein;
"Memorials" of his great master, a tract on household "Economy,"
another on a "Symposium," or feast, one called "Hiero," or on the
Greek tyrant, and an account of the "Laconian Polity," which he had so
long admired and known. The tract on "Hunting" also speaks the
experience at Skillus. The tract "On the Athenian State," preserved
among his writings, is not from his hand, but the work of an earlier
writer.</p>

<p>With the sudden rise of the Theban power, and consequent depression of
Sparta, he and other settlers around Skillus were driven out by the
Eleans, and he lost his country-seat, with all its agreeable
diversions. But probably the ageing man did not feel the transference
of his home to Corinth so keenly as an English gentleman would. He was
a thorough Greek, and therefore intensely attached to city life, Elis,
his adopted country, being the only state which consisted of a country
gentry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span> In the next place, a daily thoroughfare such as the Isthmus,
must have been far more suitable for the collecting of historical
evidence than Skillus, where the crowd came by only once in four
years. And then his grown-up sons could find something more serious to
do than hunting deer, boars, and hares in the glades of Elis. He may
have known, too, that his chances of restoration to Athens were
improving, and that he would do well to be within easy reach of
friends in that city. Indeed we find that the rescinding of exile soon
followed, and so he was able to send his two sons to do cavalry duty
for Athens (and Sparta) against the Thebans. It is, indeed, likely
that the young men were enrolled as Spartan volunteers. He himself
must have kept very close to his literary work; for in these closing
years of his life he brought out or re-edited the "Anabasis;" he
discussed "Cavalry Tactics," he kept writing up contemporary history
to the year 362 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the star of Thebes set with the death of
Epaminondas; he completed his long and perhaps tedious historical
novel, the "Education of Cyrus" (the elder), and lastly composed a
curious and fanciful tract on the "Revenues of Athens." There is no
evidence that he ever changed his residence back to his native city,
but that he often went there when no obstacle remained, from the
neighboring Corinth, is most probable. An open sailing boat could
carry him, with a fair wind, in a few hours. Though a very old man, he
was, however, still active with his pen when we lose him. His
promising remaining son disappears with him from the scene; we hear of
no descendants. The only offspring he has left us are his immortal
works. The names of these have already been given, with the exception
of the speech put into Socrates's mouth as his Defence, the tract on
"The Horse," appendant to his "Cavalry Tactics," and his "Panegyric on
Agesilaus." It remains to estimate their general features. Without
controversy, he excelled all his great contemporaries in breadth of
culture and experience, and in the variety of his interests.
Philosophy, politics, war, husbandry, sport, travel, are all
represented in his works. And upon all he has written with a clearness
and a grace which earned for him the title of the "Attic Bee." But
this breadth implies (as usual) a certain lack of depth, as is
particularly obvious in his case, owing to the almost necessary
comparison with his two mighty rivals&mdash;Thucydides, in history, Plato,
in philosophy. It may, indeed, be considered hard luck for him that he
stood between two such men, for they have necessarily damaged his
reputation by comparison. Xenophon's portrait of Socrates is quite
independent, and probably historically truer than that of Plato; but
the sage lives for us in Plato, not in Xenophon. The Retreat of the
Ten Thousand, and the wars of Epaminondas were far more brilliant than
the operations of the Peloponnesian War. Yet, to the scholar, a raid
in Thucydides is more than a campaign in Xenophon. For neither is his
style so pure as that of either of his rivals, nor is his enthusiasm
the same. We feel him always a polished man of the world&mdash;never the
rugged patriot, never the rapt seer. He seems, too, to lack
impartiality. He lavishes praise upon Agesilaus, a second-rate man,
while he is curt and ill-tempered concerning Epaminondas, the real
genius of the age. It is more than likely that he has colored his own
part in the famous "Retreat," in glowing colors. His <span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020"></a>(p. 020)</span>
hereditary instincts lead him to approve of autocrats as against
republics, Spartan discipline as against Attic freedom. Yet in himself
he has shown a striking example how the latter could appreciate and
embrace the former. As the simplest specimen of pure Attic prose he
will ever be paramount in schools, neglected in universities&mdash;the
recreation rather than the occupation of mature scholars. He is a
great worthy, a man of renown; "nevertheless, he did not attain unto
the first three"&mdash;the two masters of his own day, and the colossal
Demosthenes.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>THE GRACCHI<br>

Extracts from "Cæsar, a Sketch,"<br>
by <span class="smcap">James Anthony Froude, LL.D.</span><br>
(164-133, 153-121 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>)</h3>

</div>

<p>Tiberius Gracchus was born about the year 164 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> He was one of
twelve children, nine of whom died in infancy, himself, his brother
Caius, and his sister Cornelia being the only survivors. His family
was plebeian, but of high antiquity, his ancestors for several
generations having held the highest offices in the Republic. On the
mother's side he was the grandson of Scipio Africanus. His father,
after a distinguished career as a soldier in Spain and Sardinia, had
attempted reforms at Rome. He had been censor, and in this capacity he
had ejected disreputable senators from the Curia; he had degraded
offending Equites; he had rearranged and tried to purify the Comitia.
But his connections were aristocratic. His wife was the daughter of
the most famous of them, Scipio Africanus the Younger. He had been
himself in antagonism with the tribunes, and had taken no part, at any
time, in popular agitations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img013.jpg" width="400" height="580" alt="" title="">
<p>The Mother Of The Gracchi.</p></div>

<p>The father died when Tiberius was still a boy, and the two brothers
grew up under the care of their mother, a noble and gifted lady. They
early displayed remarkable talents. Tiberius, when old enough, went
into the army, and served under his brother-in-law in the last
Carthaginian campaign. He was first on the walls of the city in the
final storm. Ten years later he went to Spain as quæstor, when he
carried on his father's popularity, and by taking the people's side in
some questions, fell into disagreement with his brother-in-law. His
political views had perhaps already inclined to change. He was still
of an age when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021"></a>(p. 021)</span> indignation at oppression calls out a
practical desire to resist it. On his journey home from Spain he
witnessed scenes which confirmed his conviction and determined him to
throw all his energies into the popular cause. His road lay through
Tuscany, where he saw the large estate system in full operation&mdash;the
fields cultivated by the slave gangs, the free citizens of the
Republic thrust away into the towns, aliens and outcasts in their own
country, without a foot of soil which they could call their own. In
Tuscany, too, the vast domains of the landlords had not even been
fairly purchased. They were parcels of the <i>ager publicus</i>, land
belonging to the state, which, in spite of a law forbidding it, the
great lords and commoners had appropriated and divided among
themselves. Five hundred acres of state land was the most which by
statute any one lessee might be allowed to occupy. But the law was
obsolete or sleeping, and avarice and vanity were awake and active.
Young Gracchus, in indignant pity, resolved to rescue the people's
patrimony. He was chosen tribune in the year 133. His brave mother and
a few patricians of the old type encouraged him, and the battle of the
revolution began. The Senate, as has been said, though without direct
legislative authority, had been allowed the right of reviewing any new
schemes which were to be submitted to the Assembly. The constitutional
means of preventing tribunes from carrying unwise or unwelcome
measures lay in a consul's veto, or in the help of the College of
Augurs, who could declare the auspices unfavorable and so close all
public business. These resources were so awkward that it had been
found convenient to secure beforehand the Senate's approbation, and
the encroachment, being long submitted to, was passing by custom into
a rule. But the Senate, eager as it was, had not yet succeeded in
engrafting the practice into the constitution. On the land question
the leaders of the aristocracy were the principal offenders.</p>

<p>Disregarding usage, and conscious that the best men of all ranks were
with him, Tiberius Gracchus appealed directly to the people to revive
the Agrarian law. His proposals were not extravagant. That they should
have been deemed extravagant was a proof of how much some measure of
the kind was needed. Where lands had been enclosed and money laid out
on them, he was willing that the occupants should have compensation.
But they had no right to the lands themselves. Gracchus persisted that
the <i>ager publicus</i> belonged to the people, and that the race of
yeomen, for whose protection the law had been originally passed, must
be re-established on their farms. No form of property gives to its
owners so much consequence as land, and there is no point on which in
every country an aristocracy is more sensitive. The large owners
protested that they had purchased their interests on the faith that
the law was obsolete. They had planted and built and watered with the
sanction of the government, and to call their titles in question was
to shake the foundations of society. The popular party pointed to the
statute. The monopolists were entitled in justice to less than was
offered them. They had no right to a compensation at all. Political
passion awoke again after the sleep of a century. The oligarchy had
doubtless connived at the accumulations. The suppression of the small
holdings favored their supremacy, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022"></a>(p. 022)</span> and placed the elections
more completely in their control. Their military successes had given
them so long a tenure of power that they had believed it to be theirs
in perpetuity; and the new sedition, as they called it, threatened at
once their privileges and their fortunes. The quarrel assumed the
familiar form of a struggle between the rich and the poor, and at such
times the mob of voters becomes less easy to corrupt. They go with
their order, as the prospect of larger gain makes them indifferent to
immediate bribes. It became clear that the majority of the citizens
would support Tiberius Gracchus, but the constitutional forms of
opposition might still be resorted to. Octavius Cæcina, another of the
tribunes, had himself large interests in the land question. He was the
people's magistrate, one of the body appointed especially to defend
their rights, but he went over to the Senate, and, using a power which
undoubtedly belonged to him, he forbade the vote to be taken.</p>

<p>There was no precedent for the removal of either consul, prætor, or
tribune, except under circumstances very different from any which
could as yet be said to have arisen. The magistrates held office for a
year only, and the power of veto had been allowed them expressly to
secure time for deliberation and to prevent passionate legislation.
But Gracchus was young and enthusiastic. Precedent or no precedent,
the citizens were omnipotent, he invited them to declare his colleague
deposed. They had warmed to the fight, and complied. A more
experienced statesman would have known that established constitutional
bulwarks cannot be swept away by a momentary vote. He obtained his
Agrarian law. Three commissioners were appointed, himself, his younger
brother, and his father-in-law, Appius Claudius, to carry it into
effect; but the very names showed that he had alienated his few
supporters in the higher circles, and that a single family was now
contending against the united wealth and distinction of Rome. The
issue was only too certain. Popular enthusiasm is but a fire of straw.
In a year Tiberius Gracchus would be out of office. Other tribunes
would be chosen more amenable to influence, and his work could then be
undone. He evidently knew that those who would succeed him could not
be relied on to carry on his policy. He had taken one revolutionary
step already; he was driven on to another, and he offered himself
illegally to the Comitia for re-election. It was to invite them to
abolish the constitution, and to make him virtual sovereign; and that
a young man of thirty should have contemplated such a position for
himself as possible, is of itself a proof of his unfitness for it. The
election day came. The noble lords and gentlemen appeared in the
Campus Martius with their retinues of armed servants and clients;
hot-blooded aristocrats, full of disdain for demagogues, and meaning
to read a lesson to sedition which it would not easily forget. Votes
were given for Gracchus. Had the hustings been left to decide the
matter, he would have been chosen; but as it began to appear how the
polling would go, sticks were used and swords; a riot rose, the
unarmed citizens were driven off, Tiberius Gracchus himself and three
hundred of his friends were killed, and their bodies were flung into
the Tiber.</p>

<p>Thus the first sparks of the coming revolution were trampled out. But
though <span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023"></a>(p. 023)</span> quenched and to be again quenched with fiercer
struggles, it was to smoulder and smoke and burst out time after time,
till its work was done. Revolution could not restore the ancient
character of the Roman nation, but it could check the progress of
decay by burning away the more corrupted parts of it. It could destroy
the aristocracy and the constitution which they had depraved, and
under other forms preserve for a few more centuries the Roman
dominion. Scipio Africanus, when he heard in Spain of the end of his
brother-in-law, exclaimed "May all who act as he did perish like him!"
There were to be victims enough and to spare before the bloody drama
was played out. Quiet lasted for ten years, and then, precisely when
he had reached his brother's age, Caius Gracchus came forward to
avenge him, and carry the movement through another stage. Young Caius
had been left one of the commissioners of the land law; and it is
particularly noticeable that, though the author of it had been killed,
the law had survived him, being too clearly right and politic in
itself to be openly set aside. For two years the commissioners had
continued to work, and in that time forty thousand families were
settled on various parts of the <i>ager publicus</i>, which the patricians
had been compelled to resign. This was all which they could do. The
displacement of one set of inhabitants and the introduction of another
could not be accomplished without quarrels, complaints, and perhaps
some injustice. Those who entered on possession were not always
satisfied. The commissioners became unpopular. When the cries against
them became loud enough, they were suspended, and the law was then
quietly repealed. The Senate had regained its hold over the Assembly,
and had a further opportunity of showing its recovered ascendency
when, two years after the murder of Tiberius Gracchus, one of his
friends introduced a bill to make the tribunes legally re-eligible.
Caius Gracchus actively supported the change, but it had no success;
and, waiting till times had altered, and till he had arrived at an age
when he could carry weight, the young brother retired from politics,
and spent the next few years with the army in Africa and Sardinia, he
served with distinction; he made a name for himself, both as a soldier
and an administrator. Had the Senate left him alone, he might have
been satisfied with a regular career, and have risen by the ordinary
steps to the consulship. But the Senate saw in him the possibilities
of a second Tiberius; the higher his reputation, the more formidable
he became to them. They vexed him with petty prosecutions, charged him
with crimes which had no existence, and at length, by suspicion and
injustice, drove him into open war with them. Caius Gracchus had a
broader intellect than his brother, and a character considerably less
noble. The land question he perceived was but one of many questions.
The true source of the disorders of the commonwealth was the Senate
itself. The administration of the empire was in the hands of men
totally unfit to be trusted with it, and there he thought the reform
must commence. He threw himself on the people, he was chosen tribune
in 123, ten years exactly after Tiberius. He had studied the
disposition of parties. He had seen his brother fall because the
Equites and the senators, the great commoners and the nobles, were
combined against him. He revived the Agrarian law as a matter of
course, but he disarmed the opposition <span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024"></a>(p. 024)</span> to it by throwing an
apple of discord between the two superior orders. The high judicial
functions in the commonwealth had been hitherto a senatorial monopoly.
All cases of importance, civil or criminal, came before courts of
sixty or seventy jurymen, who, as the law stood, must be necessarily
senators. The privilege had been extremely lucrative. The corruption
of justice was already notorious, though it had not yet reached the
level of infamy which it attained in another generation. It was no
secret that in ordinary causes jurymen had sold their verdicts, and,
far short of taking bribes in the direct sense of the word, there were
many ways in which they could let themselves be approached, and their
favor purchased. A monopoly of privileges is always invidious. A
monopoly in the sale of justice is alike hateful to those who abhor
iniquity on principle, and to those who would like to share the
profits of it. But this was not the worst. The governors of the
provinces, being chosen from those who had been consuls or prætors,
were necessarily members of the Senate. Peculation and extortion in
these high functions were offences, in theory, of the gravest kind;
but the offender could only be tried before a limited number of his
peers, and a governor who had plundered a subject state, sold justice,
pillaged temples, and stolen all that he could lay hands on, was safe
from punishment if he returned to Rome a millionnaire and would admit
others to a share in his spoils. The provincials might send
deputations to complain, but these complaints came before men who had
themselves governed provinces, or else aspired to govern them. It had
been proved in too many instances that the law which professed to
protect them was a mere mockery.</p>

<p>Caius Gracchus secured the affections of the knights to himself, and
some slightly increased chance of an improvement in the provincial
administration, by carrying a law in the Assembly disabling the
senators from sitting on juries of any kind from that day forward, and
transferring the judicial functions to the Equites. How bitterly must
such a measure have been resented by the Senate, which at once robbed
them of their protective and profitable privileges, handed them over
to be tried by their rivals for their pleasant irregularities, and
stamped them at the same time with the brand of dishonesty! How
certainly must such a measure have been deserved when neither consul
nor tribune could be found to interpose his vote! Supported by the
grateful knights, Caius Gracchus was for the moment all-powerful. It
was not enough to restore the Agrarian law. He passed another aimed at
his brother's murderers, which was to bear fruit in later years, that
no Roman citizen might be put to death by any person, however high in
authority, without legal trial, and without appeal, if he chose to
make it, to the sovereign people. A blow was thus struck against
another right claimed by the Senate, of declaring the Republic in
danger, and the temporary suspension of the constitution. These
measures might be excused, and perhaps commended; but the younger
Gracchus connected his name with another change less commendable,
which was destined also to survive and bear fruit. He brought forward
and carried through, with enthusiastic clapping of every pair of hands
in Rome that were hardened with labor, a proposal that there should be
public granaries <span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span> in the city, maintained and filled at the
cost of the state, and that corn should be sold at a rate artificially
cheap to the poor free citizens. Such a law was purely socialistic.
The privilege was confined to Rome, because in Rome the elections were
held, and the Roman constituency was the one depositary of power. The
effect was to gather into the city a mob of needy unemployed voters,
living on the charity of the state, to crowd the circus and to clamor
at the elections, available no doubt immediately to strengthen the
hands of the popular tribune, but certain in the long run to sell
themselves to those who could bid highest for their voices. Excuses
could be found, no doubt, for this miserable expedient, in the state
of parties, in the unscrupulous violence of the aristocracy, in the
general impoverishment of the peasantry through the land monopoly, and
in the intrusion upon Italy of a gigantic system of slave labor. But
none the less it was the deadliest blow which had yet been dealt to
the constitution. Party government turns on the majorities at the
polling places, and it was difficult afterward to recall a privilege
which, once conceded, appeared to be a right. The utmost that could be
ventured in later times, with any prospect of success, was to limit an
intolerable evil, and if one side was ever strong enough to make the
attempt, their rivals had a bribe ready in their hands to buy back the
popular support. Caius Gracchus, however, had his way, and carried all
before him. He escaped the rock on which his brother had been wrecked.
He was elected tribune a second time. He might have had a third term
if he had been contented to be a mere demagogue. But he, too, like
Tiberius, had honorable aims. The powers which he had played into the
hands of the mob to obtain, he desired to use for high purposes of
statesmanship, and his instrument broke in his hands. He was too wise
to suppose that a Roman mob, fed by bounties from the treasury, could
permanently govern the world. He had schemes for scattering Roman
colonies, with the Roman franchise, at various points of the empire.</p>

<p>Carthage was to be one of them. He thought of abolishing the
distinction between Romans and Italians, and enfranchising the entire
peninsula. These measures were good in themselves&mdash;essential, indeed,
if the Roman conquests were to form a compact and permanent dominion.
But the object was not attainable on the road on which Gracchus had
entered. The vagabond part of the constituency was well contented with
what it had obtained, a life in the city, supported at the public
expense, with politics and games for its amusements. It had not the
least inclination to be drafted off into settlements in Spain or
Africa, where there would be work instead of pleasant idleness.
Carthage was still a name of terror. To restore Carthage was no better
than treason. Still less had the Roman citizens an inclination to
share their privileges with Samnites and Etruscans, and see the value
of their votes watered down. Political storms are always cyclones. The
gale from the east to-day is a gale from the west to-morrow. Who and
what were the Gracchi, then?&mdash;the sweet voices began to ask&mdash;ambitious
intriguers, aiming at dictatorship, or perhaps the crown. The
aristocracy were right, after all; a few things had gone wrong, but
these had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> been amended. The Scipios and Metelli had
conquered the world: the Scipios and Metelli were alone fit to govern
it. Thus, when the election time came round, the party of reform was
reduced to a minority of irreconcilable radicals, who were easily
disposed of. Again, as ten years before, the noble lords armed their
followers. Riots broke out and extended day after day. Caius Gracchus
was at last killed, as his brother had been, and under cover of the
disturbance three thousand of his friends were killed along with him.
The power being again securely in their hands, the Senate proceeded at
their leisure, and the surviving patriots who were in any way
notorious or dangerous were hunted down in legal manner, and put to
death or banished.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>ZENOBIA, QUEEN OF PALMYRA<br>

By <span class="smcap">Anna Jameson</span><br>

(REIGNED 267-273 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)</h3>

<p>Of the government and manners of the Arabians before the time of
Mahomet, we have few and imperfect accounts; but from the remotest
ages they led the same unsettled and predatory life which they do at
this day, dispersed in hordes, and dwelling under tents. It was not to
those wild and wandering tribes that the superb Palmyra owed its rise
and grandeur, though situated in the midst of their deserts, where it
is now beheld in its melancholy beauty and ruined splendor, like an
enchanted island in the midst of an ocean of sands. The merchants who
trafficked between India and Europe, by the only route then known,
first colonized this singular spot, which afforded them a convenient
resting-place; and even in the days of Solomon it was the emporium for
the gems and gold, the ivory, gums, spices, and silks of the far
Eastern countries, which thus found their way to the remotest parts of
Europe. The Palmyrenes were, therefore, a mixed race&mdash;their origin,
and many of their customs, were Egyptian; their love of luxury and
their manners were derived from Persia; their language, literature,
and architecture were Greek.</p>

<p>Thus, like Venice and Genoa, in more modern times, Palmyra owed its
splendor to the opulence and public spirit of its merchants; but its
chief fame and historical interest it owes to the genius and heroism
of a woman.</p>

<p>Zenobia Captive.</p></div>

<p>Septimia Zenobia, for such is her classical appellation, was the
daughter of an Arab chief, Amrou, the son of Dharb, the son of Hassan.
Of her first husband <span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span> we have no account; she was left a
widow at a very early age, and married, secondly, Odenathus, chief of
several tribes of the desert, near Palmyra, and a prince of
extraordinary valor and boundless ambition. Odenathus was the ally of
the Romans in their wars against Sapor (or, more properly, Shah Poor),
king of Persia; he gained several splendid victories over that
powerful monarch, and twice pursued his armies even to the gates of
Ctesiphon (or Ispahan), his capital. Odenathus was as fond of the
chase as of war, and in all his military and hunting expeditions he
was accompanied by his wife Zenobia&mdash;a circumstance which the Roman
historians record with astonishment and admiration, as contrary to
their manners, but which was the general custom of the Arab women of
that time. Zenobia not only excelled her countrywomen in the qualities
for which they were all remarkable&mdash;in courage, prudence, and
fortitude, in patience of fatigue, and activity of mind and body&mdash;she
also possessed a more enlarged understanding; her views were more
enlightened, her habits more intellectual. The successes of Odenathus
were partly attributed to her, and they were always considered as
reigning jointly. She was also eminently beautiful&mdash;with the oriental
eyes and complexion, teeth like pearls, and a voice of uncommon power
and sweetness.</p>

<p>Odenathus obtained from the Romans the title of Augustus, and General
of the East; he revenged the fate of Valerian, who had been taken
captive and put to death by Shah Poor: the eastern king, with a
luxurious barbarity truly oriental, is said to have used the
unfortunate emperor as his footstool to mount his horse. But in the
midst of his victories and conquests Odenathus became the victim of a
domestic conspiracy, at the head of which was his nephew Mæonius. He
was assassinated at Emessa during a hunting expedition, and with him
his son by his first marriage. Zenobia avenged the death of her
husband on his murderers, and as her sons were yet in their infancy,
she first exercised the supreme power in their name; but afterward,
apparently with the consent of the people, assumed the diadem with the
titles of Augusta and Queen of the East.</p>

<p>The Romans, and their effeminate emperor Gallienus, refused to
acknowledge Zenobia's claim to the sovereignty of her husband's
dominions, and Heraclianus was sent with a large army to reduce her to
obedience; but Zenobia took the field against him, engaged and totally
defeated him in a pitched battle. Not satisfied with this triumph over
the haughty masters of the world, she sent her general Zabdas to
attack them in Egypt, which she subdued and added to her territories,
together with a part of Armenia and Asia Minor. Thus her dominions
extended from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, and over all those
vast and fertile countries formerly governed by Ptolemy and Seleucus.
Jerusalem, Antioch, Damascus, and other cities famed in history, were
included in her empire, but she fixed her residence at Palmyra, and in
an interval of peace she turned her attention to the further adornment
of her magnificent capital. It is related by historians, that many of
those stupendous fabrics of which the mighty ruins are still existing,
were either erected, or at least restored and embellished, by this
extraordinary woman. But that which we have most difficulty in
reconciling with the manners of her age and country, was Zenobia's
passion for study, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span> her taste for the Greek and Latin
literature. She is said to have drawn up an epitome of history for her
own use; the Greek historians, poets, and philosophers were familiar
to her; she invited Longinus, one of the most elegant writers of
antiquity, to her splendid court, and appointed him her secretary and
minister. For her he composed his famous "Treatise on the Sublime," a
work which is not only admirable for its intrinsic excellence, but
most valuable as having preserved to our times many beautiful
fragments of ancient poets whose works are now lost, particularly
those of Sappho.</p>

<p>The classical studies of Zenobia seem to have inspired her with some
contempt for her Arab ancestry. She was fond of deriving her origin
from the Macedonian kings of Egypt, and of reckoning Cleopatra among
her progenitors. In imitation of the famous Egyptian queen, she
affected great splendor in her style of living and in her attire; and
drank her wine out of cups of gold richly carved and adorned with
gems. It is, however, admitted that in female dignity and discretion,
as well as in beauty, she far surpassed Cleopatra. She administered
the government of her empire with such admirable prudence and policy,
and in particular with such strict justice toward all classes of her
subjects, that she was beloved by her own people, and respected and
feared by the neighboring nations. She paid great attention to the
education of her three sons, habited them in the Roman purple, and
brought them up in the Roman fashion. But this predilection for the
Greek and Roman manners appears to have displeased and alienated the
Arab tribes; for it is remarked that after this time their fleet
cavalry, inured to the deserts and unequalled as horsemen, no longer
formed the strength of her army.</p>

<p>While Gallienus and Claudius governed the Roman empire, Zenobia was
allowed to pursue her conquests, rule her dominions, and enjoy her
triumphs almost without opposition; but at length the fierce and
active Aurelian was raised to the purple, and he was indignant that a
woman should thus brave with impunity the offended majesty of Rome.
Having subdued all his competitors in the West, he turned his arms
against the Queen of the East. Zenobia, undismayed by the terrors of
the Roman name, levied troops, placed herself at their head, and gave
the second command to Zabdas, a brave, and hitherto successful,
general. The first great battle took place near Antioch; Zenobia was
totally defeated after an obstinate conflict; but, not disheartened by
this reverse, she retired upon Emessa, rallied her armies, and once
more defied the Roman emperor. Being again defeated with great loss,
and her army nearly dispersed, the high-spirited queen withdrew to
Palmyra, collected her friends around her, strengthened her
fortifications, and declared her resolution to defend her capital and
her freedom to the last moment of her existence.</p>

<p>Zenobia was conscious of the great difficulties which would attend the
siege of a great city, well stored with provisions and naturally
defended by surrounding deserts; these deserts were infested by clouds
of Arabs, who, appearing and disappearing with the swiftness and
suddenness of a whirlwind, continually harassed her enemies. Thus
defended without, and supported by a strong garrison <span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029"></a>(p. 029)</span> within,
Zenobia braved her antagonist from the towers of Palmyra as boldly as
she had defied him in the field of battle. The expectation of succors
from the East added to her courage, and determined her to persevere to
the last. "Those," said Aurelian in one of his letters, "who speak
with contempt of the war I am waging against a woman, are ignorant
both of the character and power of Zenobia. It is impossible to
enumerate her warlike preparations of stones, of arrows, and of every
species of missile weapons and military engines."</p>

<p>Aurelian, in fact, became doubtful of the event of the siege, and he
offered the queen the most honorable terms of capitulation if she
would surrender to his arms; but Zenobia, who was aware that famine
raged in the Roman camp, and daily looked for the expected relief,
rejected his proposals in a famous Greek epistle, written with equal
arrogance and eloquence; she defied the utmost of his power; and,
alluding to the fate of Cleopatra, expressed her resolution to die
like her rather than yield to the Roman arms. Aurelian was incensed by
this haughty letter, even more than by dangers and delays attending
the siege; he redoubled his efforts, he cut off the succors she
expected; he found means to subsist his troops even in the midst of
the desert; every day added to the number and strength of his army,
every day increased the difficulties of Zenobia, and the despair of
the Palmyrenes. The city could not hold out much longer, and the queen
resolved to fly, not to insure her own safety, but to bring relief to
her capital&mdash;such at least is the excuse made for a part of her
conduct which certainly requires apology. Mounted on a fleet
dromedary, she contrived to elude the vigilance of the besiegers, and
took the road to the Euphrates; but she was pursued by a party of the
Roman light cavalry, overtaken, and brought as a captive into the
presence of Aurelian. He sternly demanded how she had dared to oppose
the power of Rome? to which she replied, with a mixture of firmness
and gentleness, "Because I disdained to acknowledge as my masters such
men as Aureolus and Gallienus. To Aurelian I submit as my conqueror
and my sovereign." Aurelian was not displeased at the artful
compliment implied in this answer, but he had not forgotten the
insulting arrogance of her former reply. While this conference was
going forward in the tent of the Roman emperor, the troops, who were
enraged by her long and obstinate resistance, and all they had
suffered during the siege, assembled in tumultuous bands calling out
for vengeance, and with loud and fierce cries demanding her instant
death. The unhappy queen, surrounded by the ferocious and insolent
soldiery, forgot all her former vaunts and intrepidity; her feminine
terrors had perhaps been excusable if they had not rendered her base;
but in her first panic she threw herself on the mercy of the emperor,
accused her ministers as the cause of her determined resistance, and
confessed that Longinus had written in her name that eloquent letter
of defiance which had so incensed the emperor.</p>

<p>Longinus, with the rest of her immediate friends and counsellors, were
instantly sacrificed to the fury of the soldiers, and the philosopher
met death with all the fortitude which became a wise and great man,
employing his last moments in endeavoring to console Zenobia and
reconcile her to her fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030"></a>(p. 030)</span> Palmyra surrendered to the conqueror, who seized upon the
treasures of the city, but spared the buildings and the lives of the
inhabitants. Leaving in the place a garrison of Romans, he returned to
Europe, carrying with him Zenobia and her family, who were destined to
grace his triumph.</p>

<p>But scarcely had Aurelian reached the Hellespont, when tidings were
brought to him that the inhabitants of Palmyra had again revolted, and
had put the Roman governor and garrison to the sword. Without a
moment's deliberation the emperor turned back, reached Palmyra by
rapid marches, and took a terrible vengeance on that miserable and
devoted city; he commanded the indiscriminate massacre of all the
inhabitants&mdash;men, women, and children; fired its magnificent edifices,
and levelled its walls to the ground. He afterward repented of his
fury, and devoted a part of the captured treasures to reinstate some
of the glories he had destroyed; but it was too late; he could not
reanimate the dead, nor raise from its ruins the stupendous Temple of
the Sun. Palmyra became desolate; its very existence was forgotten,
until about a century ago, when some English travellers discovered it
by accident. Thus the blind fury of one man extinguished life,
happiness, industry, art, and intelligence through a vast extent of
country, and severed a link which had long connected the eastern and
western continents of the old world.</p>

<p>When Aurelian returned to Rome after the termination of this war, he
celebrated his triumph with extraordinary pomp. A vast number of
elephants and tigers, and strange beasts from the conquered countries;
sixteen hundred gladiators, an innumerable train of captives, and a
gorgeous display of treasures&mdash;gold, silver, gems, plate, glittering
raiment, and Oriental luxuries and rarities, the rich plunder of
Palmyra, were exhibited to the populace. But every eye was fixed on
the beautiful and majestic figure of the Syrian queen, who walked in
the procession before her own sumptuous chariot, attired in her diadem
and royal robes, blazing with jewels, her eyes fixed on the ground,
and her delicate form drooping under the weight of her golden fetters,
which were so heavy that two slaves were obliged to assist in
supporting them on either side; while the Roman populace, at that time
the most brutal and degraded in the whole world, gaped and stared upon
her misery, and shouted in exultation over her fall. Perhaps Zenobia
may in that moment have thought upon Cleopatra, whose example she had
once proposed to follow; and, according to the pagan ideas of
greatness and fortitude, envied her destiny, and felt her own ignominy
with all the bitterness of a vain repentance.</p>

<p>The captivity of Zenobia took place in the year 273, and in the fifth
year of her reign. There are two accounts of her subsequent fate,
differing widely from each other. One author asserts that she starved
herself to death, refusing to survive her own disgrace and the ruin of
her country; but others inform us that the Emperor Aurelian bestowed
on her a superb villa at Tivoli, where she resided in great honor; and
that she was afterward united to a Roman senator, with whom she lived
many years, and died at a good old age. Her daughters married into
Roman families, and it is said that some of her descendants remained
so late as the fifth century.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>Siegfried is the name of the mythic national hero of the Germans,
whose tragic fate is most powerfully described in the "Nibelungen
Lied," and in a series of lays of the Icelandic Edda. A matchless
warrior, a Dragon-killer and overthrower of Giants, who possesses a
magic sword, he conquers the northern Nibelungs and acquires their
famed gold hoard. In the great German epic he is the son of Siegmund
and Siegelinde, who rule in the Netherlands. Going Rhine-upward to
Worms, to Gunther, the King of the Burgundians, he woos and wins
Kriemhild, the beautiful sister of that king, after having first
helped Gunther to gain the hand of Brünhild, a queen beyond sea, in
Iceland. No one could obtain that valiant virgin's consent to wedlock
unless he proved a victor over her in athletic feats, and in trials of
battle. By means of his own colossal strength and his hiding hood,
Siegfried, standing invisibly at the side of Gunther, overcomes
Brünhild. Even after the marriage has been celebrated at Worms,
Siegfried has once more to help the Burgundian king in the same hidden
way, in order to vanquish Brünhild's resistance to the accomplishment
of the marriage. When, in later times, Kriemhild and Brünhild fall out
in a quarrel about their husbands' respective worth, the secret of
such stealthy aid having been given, is let out by the former in a
manner affecting the honor of the Burgundian queen as a wife.
Thereupon Hagen promises her to effect a revenge. Having deftly
ascertained from Kriemhild the single vulnerable part of the hero,
whose skin had otherwise been made impenetrable by being dipped into
the Dragon's blood, Hagen treacherously murders Siegfried at a chase.
The gold hoard is then sunk in the Rhine by Hagen, lest Kriemhild
should use it as a means of bribing men for wreaking her own revenge.
She afterward becomes the consort of Etzel, the heathen king of the
Hiunes (Hunns) in Hungary, who resides at Vienna. Thither she allures
the Burgundians, Hagen alone mistrusting the invitation. In Etzel's
eastern land all the Burgundian knights, upon whom the Nibelung name
had been conferred, suffer a terrible death through Kriemhild's wrath.
Hagen, who refuses to the end to reveal to her the whereabouts of the
sunken gold hoard, has his head cut off with Siegfried's sword by the
infuriated queen herself. At last, she, too, is hewn down by the
indignant, doughty warrior, Hildebrand; and so the lofty Hall, into
which fire had been thrown, is all strewn over with the dead.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span> "Here," says the poem, "has the tale an end. These were the
sorrows of the Nibelungs."</p>

<p>In this "Iliad of the Germans," which dates from the end of the
twelfth century, the Siegfried story is given as a finished epic. But
its originally heathen Teutonic character is overlaid there with
admixtures of Christian chivalry. In the Edda and other Scandinavian
sources, the tale appears in fragmentary and lyrical shape, but in a
purer version, without additions from the new faith or from mediæval
chivalry. It is in the Sigurd-, Fafnir-, Brynhild-, Gudrun-, Oddrun-,
Atli-, and Hamdir Lays of the Norse Scripture that the original nature
of the older German songs, which must have preceded the epic, can best
be guessed. Rhapsodic lays, referring to Siegfried, were, in all
probability, part of the collection which Karl the Great, the Frankish
Kaiser, ordered to be made. Monkish fanaticism afterward destroyed the
valuable relics. Fortunately, Northmen travelling in Germany had
gathered some of those tale-treasures, which then were treated by
Scandinavian and Icelandic bards in the form of heroic lyrics. Hence
the Eddic lays in question form now a link between our lost Siegfried
"Lieder" and our national epic.</p>

<p>Even as in the "Nibelungen Lied" so also in the "Edda," Sigurd
(abbreviation for Siegfried) is not a Scandinavian, but a Southern, a
Rhenish, a German hero. The whole scene of the tragic events is laid
in the Rhinelands, where the killing of the Worm also takes place. On
a hill in Frank-land Sigurd frees Brynhild from the magic slumber into
which Odin had thrown her on a rock of punishment, because she, as a
Valkyr, or shield-maiden of his, had brought about the death of a
Gothic king to whom the god of battle had promised victory. In the
south, on the Rhine, Sigurd is murdered. In the Rhine, Högni (Hagen)
hides the Nibelung treasure. Many German tribes&mdash;Franks, Saxons,
Burgundians, Goths, even a Svava-land, or Suabian land, are mentioned
in the "Edda." The "Drama of Revenge," after Sigurd's death, though
motives of the act somewhat different from those stated in the
"Nibelungen Lied" are assigned, is also localized on the Lower Rhine,
in the Hall of Atli, the King of the Hunes. In the "Nibelungen Lied,"
that name appears as Etzel (Attila), King of the Hunns.</p>

<p>In the "Edda" and in the "Vilkina Saga," Germans are referred to as
sources for some details of the Sigurd story. So strong was, in
Scandinavia, the tradition of the Teutonic origin of the tale, down to
the twelfth century, that, in a geographical work written in Norse by
the Abbot Nicolaus, the Gnita Heath, where Sigurd was said to have
killed the Dragon, was still placed half-way between Paderborn and
Mainz. Thus it was from Germany that this grand saga spread all over
the North, including the Faröer. In the "Hvenic Chronicle," in Danish
songs, we even find Siegfried as "Sigfred;" Kriemhild as "Gremild;"
and she is married to him at Worms, as in the "Nibelungen Lied," while
in the "Edda" Sigurd's wife is called Gudrun, and the remembrance of
Worms is lost. The scene of the Norse poems is wholly on Rhenish
ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img017.jpg" width="400" height="567" alt="" title="">
<p>Siegfried slaying the Dragon.</p></div>

<p>Now, in that neighborhood, in the northwest of Germany, a Teutonic
tribe once dwelt, called Hunes, which is also traceable in
Scandinavia. Sigurd himself <span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span> is, in the "Edda," described
as a Hunic king. His kith and kin dwell in Huna-land. "Hune" probably
meant a bold and powerful warrior. The word still lingers in Germany
in various ways; gigantic grave-monuments of prehistoric times are
called Hunic Graves or "Hünen-Betten," and a tall, strong man a
"Hüne." In his "Church History" the Anglo-Saxon monk Baeda, or Bede,
when speaking of the various German tribes which had made Britain into
an Angle-land, or England, mentions the Hunes. In the Anglo-Saxon
"Wanderer's Tale" they also turn up, apparently in connection with a
chieftain Aetla; that is, Atli. In Friesland, the Hunsing tribe long
preserved the Hunic name. The word occurs in many personal and place
names both in Germany and in England; for instance: Hunolt (a Rhenish
hero), Hunferd, Hunlaf, Hunbrecht (champions among Frisians and
Rhinelanders in the "Beowulf" epic); Huneboldt (bold like a Hune);
Ethelhun (noble Hune); then there are, in German geography, the
Hunsrück Mountain; Hunoldstein, Hunenborn, Hunnesrück, near
Hildesheim, etc. Again, in England: Hundon, Hunworth, Hunstanton,
Huncote, Hunslet, Hunswick, and many other places from Kent and
Suffolk up to Lancashire and Shetland, where certainly no Mongolic
Hunns ever penetrated. The Hunic Atli name is also to be found on
English soil, in Attlebridge and Attleborough.</p>

<p>After the Great Migrations the various tribes and races became much
intermixed. It was by a misunderstanding which arose then between the
German Hunes and the Hunns under Attila's leadership, that Kriemhild's
revenge after the murder of Siegfried was poetically transferred from
the Rhine to the Danube. The name of the Rhenish Atli, which is
preserved in the "Edda," and which also occurs as a German chieftain's
name on the soil of conquered Britain, easily served to facilitate the
confusion. Even the composition of Attila's army lent itself to this
transplantation of the second part of the Siegfried story to Danubian
lands. For, though Attila was overthrown on the Catalaunian fields,
mainly by Germanic hosts, to which Roman and Gallic troops were added,
he had a great many Teutonic warriors in his own army. From this
military intermingling of races so utterly dissimilar in blood and
speech as the Hunns and the Germans, one of whose tribes were called
Hunes, it is not difficult to conceive the shifting of the tragic
issue of the Nibelung story to the East. Attila, the Hunn, slid into
the previous Teutonic hero-figure of Atli, the Hune. This change will
the more easily be understood when the deep impression is remembered
which the terrible Mongolic war-leader had made on the popular mind in
southern Germany, where the Nibelungen epic was cast into its present
shape.</p>

<p>The hold which the Siegfried story has had on the German people,
through ages, can be gathered from the fact of its having kept its
place, down to our days, in the workman's house and the peasant's hut,
first by oral tradition, and then by rudely printed and illustrated
chap-books ("Die Geschichte vom hürnenen Siegfried"). In this
"Volksbuch" there are remarkable details concerning the hero's early
life in a smithy and the prophecy of his assassination, which are
lost in the "Nibelungen Lied," but preserved in the "Edda." This
circumstance&mdash;overlooked <span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span> even by Simrock, who, like Jacob
Grimm, has done much to show the German origin of the Norse Sigurd
saga&mdash;is another curious bit of evidence of the undeniable Teutonic
source of the corresponding Scandinavian and Icelandic stories and
poems.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to get at the historical kernel of the
tale. Some would see in it traces of the songs which, according to
Tacitus, were sung, of old, in honor of Armin (usually, though
mistakenly, called Hermann), the deliverer of Germany from the Roman
yoke. It has been assumed that the contents of these songs were
combined with traditions of the deeds of Civilis, the leader of the
Batavian Germans against Roman dominion, as well as of the conquest of
Britain by Hengest. Recently, the Norse scholar, Gudbrand Vigfússon,
has once more started this "Armin" interpretation of the tale, under
the impression that he was the first to do so; whereas, in Germany,
Mone and Giesebrecht had worked out that idea already some sixty years
ago. In order to support his theory, Vigfússon boldly proposed to
change the Hunic name of Sigurd, in the Eddic text, into "Cheruskian."
He imagined the former name to be absurd, because Siegfried was not a
Hunn; but Vigfússon was unacquainted with the wide historical
distribution of the Hunic name in Germany and England.</p>

<p>Others saw in the Siegfried story an echo of the overthrow of the
Burgundian king Gundahari (Gunther), by Attila, on the Rhine.
Gundahari, who first threw himself with an army of 20,000 men against
the Hunnic leader, gloriously fell with all his men. In the same way,
in the "Nibelungen Lied," the Burgundian king, Gunther, is killed,
with all his men, in the land of Etzel, the ruler of the Hiunes.
Again, others have pointed to the feats of Theodorick, the king of the
Eastern Goths; or to the fate of Siegbert, the king of the Austrasian
Franks, who was murdered at the instigation of Fredegunda; or to the
powerful Frankish family of the Pipins, from whom Karl the Great
hailed, by way of trying to explain some parts of the Siegfried story.
With the Pipins of "Nivella," we come upon a word in consonance with
"Nibelung."</p>

<p>Then the wars which the Frankish Kaiser Karl waged against the Saxons
of Witukind, have been held to be indicated in the war which the
Frankish Siegfried, in the "Nibelungen Lied," wages against the
Saxons. To all appearance, however, the tale is a mixture of
mythological and historical traditions. In the Middle Ages, and still
much later, Siegfried was looked upon as an undoubtedly historical
figure. His praise was sung through all Germany. His very tomb, one of
his weapons, as well as his carved image, were shown under the name of
Siegfried's grave, Siegfried's spear, and Siegfried's statue. So
persistent was this belief that when, in the fifteenth century, Kaiser
Frederick III. came to Worms, he had the alleged grave of "that second
Hector and powerful giant" opened, to see whether his bones could be
found. Only a head and a few bones were dug up, "larger than men's
heads and bones usually are." At Worms, the Siegfried story was
pictured, in ancient times, in the Town Hall and on the Mint. All
round Worms, place-names connected with the Nibelung tale occur with
remarkable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span> frequency. If the lost rhapsodic songs could be
recovered, both mythological and historical allusions would, in all
likelihood, be found in them.</p>

<p>An eminently Frankish tale, the Nibelungen cycle, has arisen in that
martial German tribe which once held sway in the greater part of
Europe. In its origin, the tale is considered by many careful
investigators&mdash;so also by Richard Wagner, who founded his famous
music-drama on it&mdash;to have been a Nature myth, upon which real events
became engrafted. From this point of view, the earliest meaning of
Siegfried's victory over the Dragon would signify the triumph of the
God of Light over the monster of the chaotic aboriginal Night. It
would be, on German ground, the overthrow of Python by Apollon. In
this connection it is to be pointed out that Sigurd appears in the
"Edda" as the hero "with the shining eyes," and that, in one of the
German Rose Garden tales, twelve swords are attributed to him&mdash;a
description which might be referred to the zodiac and to sunshine; so
that he would be a solar hero. And even as Day is, in its turn,
vanquished by Night; as Summer must yield to Winter; so also Siegfried
falls in the end. The god which he originally was thus becomes human;
the sad fate of so noble a champion gives rise to feelings of revenge
for what is held to be an evil and criminal deed; and a tragedy is
constructed, in which generations appear as actors and victims.</p>

<p>A special feature of the Frankish myth is the hoard, the fatal
treasure which works never-ending mischief. It is said to represent
the metal veins of the subterranean Region of Gloom. There, as is
stated in an Eddic record, Dark Elves (Nibelungs, or nebulous Sons of
the Night) are digging and working, melting and forging the ore in
their smithies, producing charmful rings that remind us of the diadems
which bind the brows of rulers; golden ornaments and sharp weapons;
all of which confer great power upon their owner. When Siegfried slays
the Dragon, when Light overcomes Darkness, this hoard is his booty,
and he becomes master of the Nibelungs. But the Dragon's dark heir
ever seeks to regain it from the victor; so Night malignantly murders
the Day; Hagen kills Siegfried. The treasure on which Siegfried's
power is founded becomes the cause of his death; and through Death he
himself, albeit originally a refulgent God of Light, is turned into a
figure of gloom; that is, a Nibelung.</p>

<p>There is much in the Norse Skalds which seems to support this
mythological aspect of the tale. The name of Siegfried's murderer,
Hagen&mdash;who is one-eyed, even as Hödur, the God of Night, who kills
Baldur, the God of Light, is blind&mdash;has also been adduced for this
interpretation. Hagen is explained as the Thorn of Death, the hawthorn
(German Hagedorn), with which men are stung into eternal sleep, or
rather into a death-like trance. Odin stings Brynhild into her trance
with a sleeping-thorn. Hagen, in the sense of death, still lingers in
the German expression, "Friend Hain," as a euphemism for the figure
which announces that one's hour has come. The hawthorn was the special
wood used for fire-burial in Germany; hence the figurative poetical
expression which would make Hagen a synonym for death.</p>

<p>In the German and Norse poems, as we possess them now, myth and
apparently <span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span> historical facts are inextricably welded
together. A powerful representation of the Siegfried tale is given in
the series of large pictures, at Munich, by the distinguished painter
Schnorr von Karolsfeld.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>KING ARTHUR<br>

By <span class="smcap">Rev. S. Baring-Gould</span><br>

(ABOUT 520)</h3>

<a id="img018" name="img018"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img018.jpg" width="250" height="263" alt="King Arthur." title="">
</div>

<p>Arthur, king of the Siluri, or Dumnonii&mdash;British races driven back
into the west of England by the Saxons&mdash;is represented as having
united the British tribes in resisting the pagan invaders, and as
having been the champion not only of his people but also of
Christianity. He is said to have lived in the sixth century, and to
have maintained a stubborn contest against the Saxon Cerdic, but the
"Saxon Chronicle" is suspiciously silent as to his warfare and as to
his existence. Indeed, the Welsh bards of the earliest period do not
assert that he was a contemporary, and it is more than doubtful
whether he is an historic personage. It is worthy of remark that the
fame of Arthur is widely spread; he is claimed alike as a prince in
Brittany, Cornwall, Wales, Cumberland, and the lowlands of Scotland;
that is to say, his fame is conterminous with the Brithonic race, and
does not extend to the Goidels or Gaels. As is now well known, Great
Britain was twice invaded by races of Celtic blood and tongue; the
first wave was that of the Goidels, and after a lapse of some
considerable time a second Celtic wave, that of the Brithons, or
Britons, from the east, overran Britain, and drove the Gaels to west
and north. Finn and Ossian belong to the mythic heroic cycle of the
Gaels, and Arthur and Merlin to that of the Britons. These several
shadowy forms are probably deities shorn of their divinity and given
historic attributes and position, much as, among the Norsemen, Odin,
when he ceased to be regarded as the All-father, or God, came to be
reckoned as an ancestor of the kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037"></a>(p. 037)</span> In the lays of the Welsh bards, supposed to be as early as
the sixth and seventh centuries (although no MS. is extant of older
date than the twelfth century), Arthur and his brave companions are
celebrated, but modestly and without marvels. It is possible that
there may have existed in the sixth century a prince bearing the
already well-known heroic name; and if so, about him the myths
belonging to the remote ancestor or god have crystallized. The
legendary additions begin to gather in the history of the Britons by
Nennius, a writer supposed to have lived at the beginning of the
seventh century; but Mr. Thomas Wright has shown ("Biographia
Literaria," Saxon period) that his history is a forgery of a much
later date, probably of the tenth century. Mr. Skene, however ("The
Four Ancient Books of Wales"), makes fight to give Arthur an historic
place, and we do not deny that there may have been a prince of that
name. Next in order come the so-called Armoric collections of Walter,
Archdeacon of Oxford (latter part of eleventh century), from which
Geoffrey of Monmouth professes to translate, and in which the
marvellous and supernatural elements largely prevail. Here for the
first time the magician Merlin comes into association with Arthur.
According to Geoffrey, Arthur's father, Uther, conceiving a passion
for Igerna, wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, is changed by Merlin
into the likeness of Gorlois, and Arthur is the result. After his
father's death Arthur becomes paramount leader of the British, and
makes victorious expeditions to Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Norway,
and also to France, where he defeats a great Roman army. During his
absence his nephew, Modred, revolts, and seduces Prince Arthur's wife,
Gweniver (Gwenhwywar). Arthur returning, falls in a battle with his
nephew, and is carried to the Isle of Avalon to be cured of his
wounds. Geoffrey's work apparently gave birth to a multitude of
fictions, which came to be considered as quasi-historical traditions.
From these, exaggerated by each succeeding age, and recast by each
narrator, sprung the famous metrical romances of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, first in French and afterward in English, from
which modern notions of Arthur are derived. In these his habitual
residence is at Caerlon, on the Usk, in Wales, where, with his
beautiful wife, Guinevere, he lives in splendid state, surrounded by
hundreds of knights and beautiful ladies, who serve as patterns of
valor, breeding, and grace to all the world. Twelve knights, the
bravest of the throng, form the centre of this retinue, and sit with
the king at a round table, the "Knights of the Round Table." From the
court of King Arthur knights go forth to all countries in search of
adventure&mdash;to protect women, chastise oppressors, liberate the
enchanted, enchain giants and malicious dwarfs, is their knightly
mission.</p>

<p>The earliest legends of Arthur's exploits are to be found in the
bardic lays attributed to the sixth and seventh centuries ("Myoyrian
Archæology of Wales," 1801). A Welsh collection of stories called the
"Mabinogion," of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and
translated into English by Lady Charlotte Guest in 1849, gives further
Arthurian legends. Some of the stories "have the character of
chivalric romances," and are therefore probably of French origin;
while others "bear the impress of a far higher antiquity, both as
regards the manners they depict <span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span> and the style of language in
which they are composed." These latter rarely mention Arthur, but the
former belong, as Mr. Skene puts it, to the "full-blown Arthurian
romance." Chrétien de Troies, the most famous of the old French
trouvères in the latter part of the twelfth century, made the Arthur
legend the subject for his "Romans" and "Contes," as well as for two
epics on Tristan; the Holy Grail, Peredur, etc., belonging to the same
cycle. Early in the same century the Arthurian metrical romance became
known in Germany, and there assumed a more animated and artistic form
in the "Parzival" of Wolfram of Eschenbach, "Tristan und Isolt" of
Gottfried of Strasburg, "Erec and Iwein" of Hartmann, and "Wigalois"
of Wirnt. The most renowned of the heroes of the Arthurian school are
Peredur (Parzival or Perceval), Tristan or Tristram, Iwein, Erec,
Gawein, Wigalois, Wigamur, Gauriel, and Lancelot. From France the
Arthurian romance spread also to Spain, Provence, Italy, and the
Netherlands, even into Iceland, and was again transplanted into
England. One of the publications that issued from the press of Caxton
(1485) was a collection of stories by Sir Thomas Malory, either
compiled by him in English, from various of the later French prose
romances, or translated directly from an already existing French
compendium. Copland reprinted the work in 1557, and in 1634 the last
of the black-letter editions appeared. A reprint of Caxton's "Kynge
Arthur," with an introduction and notes by Robert Southey, was issued
in 1817&mdash;"The Byrth, Lyfe, and Actes of Kyng Arthur." The most
complete edition is that by Thomas Wright, from the text of 1634.</p>

<p>The name of King Arthur was given during the Middle Ages to many
places and monuments supposed to have been in some way associated with
his exploits, such as "Arthur's Seat," near Edinburgh, "Arthur's
Oven," on the Carron, near Falkirk, etc. What was called the sepulchre
of his queen was shown at Meigle, in Strathmore, in the sixteenth
century. Near Boscastle, in Cornwall, is Pentargain, a headland called
after him "Arthur's Head." Other localities take his name in Brittany.
In the Middle Ages, in Germany, Arthur's Courts were buildings in
which the patricians assembled. One such still remains at Danzig.
There was one anciently at Thorn, about which a ballad and legend
exist. Milton was meditating an Arthurian epic in 1639; and in our own
day the interest of the legends about King Arthur and his knights has
been revived by Tennyson's "Idylls of the King" and some of Wagner's
operas. We must not omit to note the magnificent life-sized ideal
bronze figure of Arthur, cast for the monument of Maximilian I., now
in the Franciscan church at Innsbruck, and regarded as the finest
among the series of heroes there represented.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>"A Roland for an Oliver!" Saving the passing reference by Scott and
Milton, quoted above, Roland and Olivier are almost unknown to English
readers, and yet their once familiar names, knit together for
centuries, have passed into a proverb, to be remembered as we remember
the friendship of David and Jonathan, or to be classed by the scholar
with Pylades, and Orestes of classic story, or with Amys and Amylion
of romance.</p>

<p>The "Song of Roland" might be called the national epic of France. It
corresponds to the "Mort d'Arthur" of England, the "Cid Chronicles" of
Spain, the "Nibelungen Lied" of Germany, and the Longobardian legends
of North Italy. Italian mediæval literature is rich in the Roland
romances, founded on the fabulous "Chronicle of John Turpin" and the
"Chansons de Gestes," of which the "Song of Roland" is one. Of the
Italian romances the "Morgante Maggiore" of Pulci was published as
early as 1488, Boyardo's "Orlando Innamorata" in 1496, and Ariosto's
"Orlando Furioso" in 1515. English versions of Boyardo and Ariosto
have since been translated into the rhyming couplets of Hoole, and as
late as 1831 into the <i>ottava rima</i> stanzas of W. S. Rose. It was not,
however, till April, 1880, that a full English translation of the
original "Song of Roland," from MSS. written in the old <i>langue d'oil</i>
of Northern France, was published by Kegan, Paul &amp; Co., from the pen
of Mr. O'Hagan, Q.C., of Dublin. Most probably it was a curtailed
version of this romance that is referred to by Wace in his "Roman le
Rou," when he records how, as the Normans marched to Senlac Hill, in
1066, the minstrel Taillefer sang,</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "Of Roland and the heroes all<br>
  Who fell at fatal Roncesvall."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span> Turning to the historical data on which the romance is based,
it will be found that in the year 778 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Charlemagne, accompanied by
his nephew, Count Roland of Bretagne, and the flower of Frankish
chivalry, made a raid across the Spanish border. Abdalrahman, the
first of the great Spanish caliphs of Cordova, was engaged in putting
down the rebellious chiefs who had refused to own their allegiance to
the new caliphate. The frontier was therefore comparatively
unprotected. The Spanish Christians, who maintained a precarious
independence among the Asturias and Pyrenees, and who found it the
wisest policy to be at peace with the Mohammedan rulers, were not
strong enough to resist Charlemagne. Accordingly the Franks advanced
nearly to Saragossa. On returning to France laden with spoil through
the winding defile of Roncesvalles (the valley of thorns or briers),
their rear-guard was cut off by a band of Basques or Gascons and
Spanish-Arabians, and their leader, Roland, slain. To the presence of
these Spanish Christians in the Moorish army must be attributed the
origin of the many Spanish ballads on the victory, in which all the
glory is due to the prowess of the national hero, Bernardo Del Carpio,
"the doughtiest lance in Spain." It is curious also to note, on the
other hand, that the Arabians themselves in their chronicles,
translated by the Spanish historian Condé, make little of this
victory, merely mentioning the fact. The Saracen King Marsil, or
Marsilius, of Saragossa, so often referred to in this and other
Carlovingian romances, is identified by Condé with the Mohammedan
Wali, or Governor of Saragossa, Abdelmelic, the son of Omar, called by
the Christians Omarus Filius, hence the corruption Marsilius.</p>

<p>With these brief outlines of the history of Roncesvalles before us it
is interesting to observe the grandiloquent strain of the old Norman
<i>rymours</i>, the fearless exaggerations, and the total ignorance of the
actual state of affairs in Spain under the enlightened and
accomplished Arabians.</p>

<p class="poem30">
  <i>"Carles li reis nostre emperere magnes,<br>
  Set anz tut pleins ad estet en Espaigne."</i></p>

<p>Our great emperor Charles the King had been for seven full years in
Spain, so runs the chronicle; castle and keeper alike had gone down
except Saragossa, the mountain town, where King Marsil held his court,
surrounded by 20,000 Mohammedan nobles. At their council it was agreed
to accept Spain as a fief from the emperor, and ten knights set out
with golden bridles and silver saddles,</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "And they ride with olive boughs in hand,<br>
  To seek the lord of the Frankish land."</p>

<p>Near the pass of Roncesvalles, one of the Pyrenean "gates" of Spain,
sits the emperor upon a throne of beaten gold. His form is tall and
majestic, and his long white beard flows over his coat of mail. 'Tis
whispered, too, that he is already two hundred years old, and yet,
there he is in all his pride. Beside him stand his nephew Roland, the
Lord Marquis of the marches of Bretagne; Sir <span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> Olivier;
Geoffrey of Anjou, the progenitor of the Plantagenets; "and more than
a thousand Franks of France." The Moslem knights are introduced to
this council of war, King Marsil's offer is accepted, and Sir Ganelon
is sent to Saragossa to represent the emperor. Jealous of Roland's
military glory, and envious of the stores of pagan gold, the false
Ganelon conspires with King Marsil to put the all-powerful Roland to
death. King Marsil is assured that on receipt of the golden tribute,
Charlemagne will be persuaded to leave Spain, while by the traitor's
advice Roland will be appointed to remain behind and guard the rear of
the retiring hosts. The scheme succeeded. Ganelon returned to the
Frankish camp with the tribute-money for the emperor, and the
traitor's gold for himself. The Franks begin their homeward march.
They are now descending the mountains into their own fertile Gascon
plains, and their hearts beat lightly, for</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "They think of their homes and their manors there,<br>
  Their gentle spouses and damsels fair."</p>

<p>But their great chief is silent and gloomy. Roland, the bravest of the
brave, has been left behind with all the paladins, save Ganelon,
beyond the gates of Spain. Last night the emperor dreamed he seemed to
stand by Cizra's pass in Roncesvalles, when Ganelon appeared before
him, wrenched the emperor's spear from out his hand, waved it on high,
then dashed it in pieces. What did it mean? He remembered the ominous
words of his peers, "Evil will come of this quest, we fear," and
Ganelon's strange reply, "Ye shall hear."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Roland was far behind in Roncesvalles. He rode his
gallant steed Veillantif; his white pennon, fringed with gold and set
with diamonds, sparkled in the sunshine; and by his side he wore his
famous sword Durindana, with its hilt of gold shaped like a cross, on
which was graven the name of "Jesus." What a glorious picture of the
Christian hero of mediæval times! With him were Olivier, the good
Archbishop Turpin, and the remaining knights who made up the Order of
the Paladins of Charlemagne, together with an army of 20,000 men.</p>

<p>The drums beat to arms in Saragossa's town, the tambours roll, the
tabors sound, and 400,000 men attend the call of King Marsil. From a
neighboring height Sir Olivier observes this countless host
approaching. He calls to Roland to blow his ivory horn and bring back
the emperor. Roland refuses, and the Franks prepare to fight; not,
however, before on bended knee they receive the archbishop's
benediction and a promise of paradise to all who die in this holy war
against the pagan foe. With the old French battle-cry, "Mont-joie!
Mont-joie!" the Christians dash the rowels into their steeds and close
with the enemy. Homer does not relate a bloodier fight than that which
follows, and which takes eighty-six stanzas, or fifty of Mr. O'Hagan's
pages, to describe. Again and again the Christians charge the
Saracens. What deeds the great sword Durindana did that day! The slain
lie in thousands; the Saracens flee; and in the pursuit all are killed
save <i>one</i>, who reaches Saragossa. The triumph, however, is
short-lived; Ganelon had decreed that Roland must die, and so a
mightier <span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span> army than before marches forth to exterminate
Roland's handful, now reduced to 300.</p>

<p>During this battle a terrible storm passes over France,&mdash;thunder and
whirlwinds, rain and hail, there came.</p>

<p>The people thought that the end of the world had come, but this was
only a foreshadowing of Roland's death. At last all the nobles are
killed except Roland, Olivier, the archbishop, and sixty men. Then
only will Roland deign to blow his horn. Charlemagne hears it thirty
leagues away, and orders his army to return to Roncesvalles. Ganelon
alone seeks to dissuade him, and is put in chains by the desire of the
nobles, who suspect him. The army of Charles hurries back, but all too
late. They will not arrive in time. Away in the Pass of Cizra, Roland
looks around on his dead comrades and weeps. He returns to Olivier's
side, who is engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter with King Marsil's
uncle, the Moslem prince, Algalif, from whom he receives his
death-wound. Olivier reels in his saddle, his eyes are dimmed with
blood, and as he strikes madly about with his spear, he smashes
Roland's helmet. The friend of Olivier is astonished, but soft and low
he speaks to him thus:</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "'Hast thou done it, my comrade, wittingly?<br>
  Roland who loves thee so dear am I.<br>
  Thou hast no quarrel with me to seek?'<br>
  Olivier answered, 'I hear thee speak,<br>
  But I see thee not; God seeth thee.<br>
  Have I struck thee, brother, forgive it me?'<br>
  'I am not hurt, O Olivier;<br>
  And in sight of God, I forgive thee here.'<br>
  Then to each other his head hath laid,<br>
  And in love like this was their parting made."</p>

<p>With hands clasped Sir Olivier cries to God for admittance into
Paradise, and for a blessing on "King Karl and France the fair," and
above all on his brother Roland. Then his hands fall, his head sinks
on his breast, and he passes away. Filled with grief, Roland murmurs:</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "So many days and years gone by<br>
  We lived together.<br>
  And thou hast never done me wrong.<br>
  Since thou art dead, to live is pain."</p>

<p>Once more Roland turns to where Count Walter of Hum and the archbishop
alone stand at bay:</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "And the heathen cries, 'What a felon three!<br>
  Look to it, lords, that they shall not flee.'"</p>

<a id="img021" name="img021"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img021.jpg" width="400" height="586" alt="" title="">
<p>Roland at Roncesvalles.</p></div>

<p>Count Walter falls at last, just as they hear the welcome sound of
Charlemagne's trumpets, at which the Saracens flee, leaving Roland and
the archbishop unconquered. But their end is near. Roland swoons, and
the good archbishop, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span> in attempting to bring water in the
famous horn for the dying Paladin, falls from loss of blood. Roland
recovers only in time to see him die; then, as he feels that death is
near him also, he looks once more on his goodly sword Durindana, and
as he looks he cries:</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "Oh fair and holy, my peerless sword,<br>
  What relics lie in thy pommel stored&mdash;<br>
  Tooth of St. Peter, Saint Basil's blood,<br>
  Hair of St. Denis beside them strewed,<br>
  Fragment of Holy Mary's vest&mdash;<br>
  'Twere shame that thou with the heathen rest,<br>
  Thee should the hand of a Christian serve,<br>
  One who should never in battle swerve."</p>

<p>In despair lest it fall into pagan hands he tries to break it in
pieces, and the mighty slashes he made in the rocks are still pointed
out as the "Brèche de Roland." You remember Wordsworth's lines:</p>

<p class="poem30">
<span class="add7em">"the Pyrenean breach,</span><br>
  Which Roland clove with huge two-handed sway,<br>
  And to the enormous labor left his name,<br>
  Where unremitting frost the rocky crescents bleach."</p>

<p>Surely Roland might now rest from his labors, amid the "flowerets of
Paradise." But no; he had yet to smash the head of a prowling Saracen
who thought him an easy prey. In doing so he spoiled forever the ivory
horn, his only weapon. Not till then could he clasp his hands as he
went to rest, and not till then did</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "God from on high send down to him<br>
  One of His angel cherubim."</p>

<p>St. Michael it was, who with St. Gabriel bore his soul to Paradise.</p>

<p>It would be too long a story to tell of the vengeance of the Emperor
Charles, how <i>the sun stood still</i> till the Franks had killed every
one of the Saracens; how Ganelon was accused of treachery, tried by
combat, and sentenced to be torn to pieces by wild horses. The story
is a true tragedy, terrible as the tragedy of &OElig;dipus. From another
source we gather the mournful sequel.</p>

<p>Long before the battle of Roncesvalles Roland and Olivier had met in
single combat on a quiet island in the Rhone. Toward even a fleecy
cloud hovered over them, and from its midst an angel "wrapped in rosy
light" separated the combatants, bidding them be friends, and telling
them to turn their swords against the enemies of the Faith. The heroes
shook hands, the angel vanished, and from that day there were no truer
friends than Roland and Olivier. Their union was further cemented by
the betrothal of Roland to the Lady Alda, Sir Olivier's sister, a
maiden who had already, in Roland's presence, proved herself as bold
in war as she was loving in peace.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>When King Harold the Fair-haired, in 872 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, had united all the
scattered earldoms of Norway under his own sway, he issued a stringent
order forbidding pillaging within his kingdom under penalty of
outlawry. The custom of sailing out into the world as a viking and
plundering foreign lands, was held to be a most honorable one in those
days; and every chieftain who wished to give his sons the advantages
of "a liberal education" and foreign travel, strained his resources in
order to equip them for such an expedition. But the Norwegians of the
ninth century had as yet no national feeling; and they regarded King
Harold's prohibition against plundering their own shores as absurd and
arbitrary. Rollo or Rolf, the son of the king's best friend, Ragnvald,
Earl of Möre, undertook to disregard the order. Coming home from a
cruise in the Baltic and being short of provisions, he landed in the
south of Norway and made havoc among the coast dwellers. The king,
determined to make an end of the nefarious practice, kept his word and
outlawed him.</p>

<p>Rollo, being unequal to a struggle with the king, betook himself to
the Hebrides, where a number of other Norse chieftains had sought a
refuge from similar persecutions. His great strength and sagacity, no
less than his distinguished birth, secured him a favorable reception
and much influence. He was so tall that no Norwegian horse could carry
him, for which reason he was compelled always to walk, and was
surnamed Rollo the Ganger, or Walker. Though not formally recognized
as chieftain, he seems gradually, by dint of his eminence, to have
assumed command over the Norse exiles; and it was probably at his
advice that they resolved to abandon the bleak and barren Hebrides,
and seek a more congenial home in a sunnier clime. At all events a
large expedition was fitted out and set sail for the south, early in
the tenth century. It landed first in Holland, but finding that
all-too-accessible country already devastated by other vikings, they
proceeded to the coast of France and entered the mouth of the river
Seine. Charles the Simple, a feeble, foolish, and good-natured man,
was then king of France, but utterly unequal to the task of defending
his territory against foreign invaders or domestic pretenders. The
empire of Charlemagne had been broken up and divided among his
grandsons; and the fraction which was to be France, was then confined
between the Loire and the Meuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> Here was a golden opportunity for Rollo the Ganger and his
vikings. Meeting with no formidable opposition, they sailed up the
Seine and cast anchor at the town of Jumièges, five leagues from
Rouen. This ancient city, which had suffered much from recent sieges
and invasions, was in no condition to defend itself. It was of slight
avail that the priests chanted in the churches, with the fervor of
despair: "Deliver us, oh God, from the fury of Norsemen!" The vikings
continued to pillage the surrounding territory, and were daily
expected to sack the city. In this dire dilemma the Archbishop of
Rouen offered himself as an ambassador to the pagans, in the hope that
perhaps he might become an instrument in the hand of God to avert the
impending doom. But if, as seemed more probable, martyrdom was in
store for him, he was ready to face death without flinching. Rollo,
however, who could honor courage even in an enemy, received him
courteously, and after a brief negotiation pledged himself, in case
the city surrendered, to take peaceful possession of it and to molest
no one. This pledge he kept to the letter. His ships sailed up the
river, and the tall chieftain, at the head of his band of
yellow-haired warriors, made his entry into Rouen, without a sword
being drawn or a torch lighted. He inspected the fortifications, the
water supply, and all points of strategic interest, and finding
everything tolerably satisfactory, resolved to remain. Making Rouen
his headquarters and base of supplies, the Norsemen made expeditions
up the Seine and established a great fortified camp near the
confluence of the Seine and the Eure. Hither a French army, under the
command of Regnault, Duke of France, was sent to drive them out of the
country. But before risking a battle Regnault chose to negotiate. He
sent a certain Hasting, Count of Chartres, to Rollo in order to find
out what was the aim and object of his invasion. This Hasting was
himself a Norseman, and had, twenty years before, proved himself so
formidable a foe, that the King of France had been compelled to buy
his friendship by a concession of land and a noble title, in return
for which favors Hasting had become a Christian and a vassal to the
king. It was doubtful, perhaps, if this man, even though he may have
acted in good faith, was the best ambassador to his countrymen. For he
was himself a living example of what might be gained by audacity and a
shrewd use of one's advantages.</p>

<p>The following conversation is reported to have taken place between the
Count of Chartres and the Norwegian vikings:</p>

<p>"Gallant soldiers!" shouted Hasting, from afar, "what is your
chieftain's name?"</p>

<p>"We have no lord over us," they replied; "we are all equal."</p>

<p>"For what purpose have you come to France?"</p>

<p>"To drive out the people who are here, or make them our subjects, and
win for ourselves a new country. But who are you? How is it that you
speak our tongue?"</p>

<p>"You know the story of Hasting," the count made answer; "Hasting, the
great viking, who scoured the seas with his multitude of ships, and
did so much damage in this kingdom?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span> "Ay, we have heard of that; but Hasting has made a bad end to
so good a beginning."</p>

<p>"Will you submit to King Charles?" was the ambassador's next query.
"Will you give your faith and service, and receive from him gifts and
honor?"</p>

<p>"No, no," they cried back; "we will not submit to King Charles. Go
back and tell him so, you messenger, and say that we claim the rule
and dominion of whatever we win by our own strength and our swords."</p>

<p>Hasting lost no time in communicating this message to the French and
in urging a compromise. But Regnault called him a traitor, and would
have none of his advice. He promptly attacked Rollo and his Norsemen,
but suffered an overwhelming defeat. His army was cut to pieces, and
he himself slain by a fisherman of Rouen who had attached himself to
the invading force. Rollo followed up his victory by sailing up the
river and laying siege to Paris; but the capital of France proved too
strong for him and he had to retire to Rouen, whence he continued to
havoc the surrounding country. He conquered the city of Bayeux and
slew its ruler, Count Berenger, whose beautiful daughter, Popa, he
married. Instead of organizing mere plundering expeditions, Rollo
gradually changed his tactics and took permanent possession of the
towns that fell into his hands. The peasants, too, who lived in the
open country, found that it was their best policy to seek his
friendship and pay him tribute, rather than rely upon the uncertain
protection of the King of France. They had discovered before this that
Rollo was a man whose word could be trusted&mdash;a lord of mighty will,
who had a ruthless way of enforcing obedience, but was open-handed and
generous withal to those who would serve his purposes.</p>

<p>It could no longer be said with truth, as the vikings had said to
Hasting, that they had no lord over them. Rollo, whose chieftainship
had hitherto been based upon his genius for ruling, was now formally
chosen king&mdash;a title which he later exchanged for that of Duke of
Normandy. In Norway, previous to the conquests of Harold the
Fair-haired, each province had had its king, who was not always
hereditary, but was often chosen by the peasants themselves, because
he possessed the qualities required of a leader. It was in accordance
with the same custom that they now conferred kingship upon Rollo,
whose valor, sagacity, and firmness of purpose had been amply proven.
It was the power of the man&mdash;the weight and force of his
personality&mdash;which they respected, no less than his clear-sightedness,
his readiness of resource, and his skill in the rude statecraft of his
age.</p>

<a id="img023" name="img023"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img023.jpg" width="400" height="588" alt="" title="">
<p>Rollo the Ganger attacks Paris.</p></div>

<p>Encouraged by his previous successes, Rollo now made larger plans, and
with the view to carrying them out, formed an alliance with some
Danish vikings who had managed to effect a lodgement and maintain
themselves for some years at the mouth of the Loire. Together they
started upon an extensive campaign, the objective point of which was
again Paris. But the powerful fortifications baffled the Norsemen, who
possessed no machinery of destruction fit to cope with such defences.
The siege had therefore to be abandoned. Dijon and Chartres also made
a successful resistance. But a long chain of smaller cities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047"></a>(p. 047)</span> surrendered, and the country was ravaged far and wide. The
peasants took to the woods and refused to sow their fields, knowing
that there was small chance of their reaping them. So desperate became
the situation that nobles and peasants alike entreated the king to
make peace with the Norsemen on whatever terms he could procure. The
king was not unwilling to listen to such prayers. It occurred to him
that in making a treaty with Rollo he would be killing two birds with
one stone. He would not only be ridding France of a dangerous foe, but
he might secure for himself a powerful friend who might help him keep
the unruly nobles in order, and secure him in the possession of his
shorn and reduced kingdom. With this end in view he invested Rollo
with the sovereignty of his northern province, named after the
Norsemen, Normandy, and conferred upon him the title of duke (912
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). Rollo was to recognize Charles as his overlord, and defend him
against external and internal foes; and he was to become a Christian
and marry the king's daughter, Gisla. It is told, however, that when
Rollo was required to kneel down and kiss the royal foot in token of
fealty, he stoutly refused.</p>

<p>"I will never bend my knee before any man," he said, "nor will I kiss
anyone's foot."</p>

<p>After much persuasion however, he permitted one of his men to perform
the act of homage in his stead. His proxy stalked sullenly forward,
and pausing before the king, who was on horseback, seized his foot and
raised it to his lips. By this man&oelig;uvre, the king came to make a
somersault, at which there followed a great and disrespectful burst of
laughter from the Norsemen.</p>

<p>Shortly after the conclusion of this treaty Rollo was baptized, and
his marriage to the Princess Gisla was celebrated with great pomp in
the city of Rouen. His previous marriage to Popa does not seem to have
caused him any scruple, though, as a matter of fact, he continued to
regard the latter as his wife, and when Gisla died he resumed his
marital relations with her, if indeed they had ever been interrupted.
The princess had been to him nothing but a hostage from the king and a
pledge of his good faith. But Popa, who was the mother of his son
William, surnamed Longsword, he loved, and we do not hear that the
fact that he had killed her father caused any serious trouble between
them.</p>

<p>As Duke of Normandy, Rollo exhibited a political insight and a genius
for administration which in those turbulent days was certainly
remarkable. He had the true welfare of his people at heart, and with a
firm hand he maintained justice, protecting the weak, and restraining
the strong. The laws which he made he enforced with stern
impartiality, and no man could plead birth or privilege before him, if
he wantonly offended. The farmers were Rollo's special care; for
warrior though he was, he well knew that war is destructive, and that
the prosperity of a land must be founded upon productive labor. The
peasantry of Normandy were not slow to discover that they were better
off under their new ruler than they ever had been under the old; and
they rewarded Rollo with a sincere loyalty and devotion. Their
confidence in his power to right wrong, became in the course of time
half superstitious; and if any of them was in peril <span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> or
suffered at the hands of his enemy, it became the fashion to shout:
"Ha, Rou!"&mdash;Rou being a corruption of Raoul, the French form of Rolf
or Rollo. Then it was the duty of everyone who heard this cry, to
hasten to the aid of the sufferer or to pursue his assailant. It has
been asserted that our "hurrah" is derived from this Norman shout, but
I hold this to be more than doubtful.</p>

<p>That Normandy was prosperous under the reign of Rollo, and that its
people were contented, seems, however, to be well established.
According to the legend, so great was the public security that
property left on the highway could be found untouched after days and
weeks; the farmer left his implements in the field without fear of
losing them; and theft and robbery became comparatively rare. In a
great measure this was, no doubt, due to the strict organization which
Rollo introduced, and his insistence upon the personal accountability
of each one of his subjects to himself. For he had learned one most
important lesson from his enemy, Harold the Fair-haired. This king was
the first to establish in Europe what is called the feudal system of
land-tenure. He declared all land to be the property of the crown, and
merely held in fief by the nominal owners. In recognition of the
king's proprietorship, the latter, therefore, pledged themselves to
pay a certain tribute, and to support the king in case of war, with a
given number of armed men, in accordance with the size and value of
their holdings. This same system Rollo is said to have introduced into
Normandy, whence it spread over all Europe. Though we have now no more
use for it, it proved a great and important element in the progress of
civilization.</p>

<p>Rollo the Ganger must have been nearly eighty years old when he died
in 927. His son, William Longsword, who succeeded him as Duke of
Normandy, was a man of gentler disposition and in vigor and sagacity
inferior to his father. Rollo's descendant in the fifth generation was
William the Conqueror, who inherited in a larger measure the qualities
of his great ancestor.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>The story of the Finding of Wineland the Good is contained, in
somewhat differing versions, in two parchment books, the one belonging
to the first, and the other to the last, quarter of the fourteenth
century. Both agree in attributing the discovery to Leif the Lucky,
the son of Eric the Red; though the Flatey Book says that he was
induced to undertake this voyage by a certain Bjarne Herjulfson, who,
having been driven out of his course by storms, had seen strange
lands, but had not explored them.</p>

<p>Leif's father, Eric the Red, was, like most Norsemen of his day, an
unruly and turbulent man, whose sword sat loosely in its sheath. He
was born about the middle of the tenth century at Jaederen, in Norway,
but was outlawed on account of a manslaughter, and set sail for
Iceland, where he married a certain Thorhild, the daughter of Jorund
and Thorbjorg the Ship-chested. But the same high temper and
quarrelsome spirit which had compelled him to leave Norway got him
into trouble also in his new home. He was forced by blood-feuds and
legal acts of banishment to change his abode repeatedly, and finally
he was declared an outlaw. Knowing that his life was forfeited, Eric,
as a last desperate chance, equipped a ship, and sailed "in search of
that land which Gunbjörn, the son of Ulf the Crow, had seen when he
was driven westward across the main;" and promised, in case he found
it, to return and apprise his friends of the discovery. Fortune
favored him, and he found a great, inhospitable continent, which (in
order to allure colonists) he called Greenland; "for," he said, "men
would be more easily persuaded thither, if the country had a good
name." He landed in three or four places, but, being dissatisfied,
broke up and started in search of more favorable localities. At the
end of three years he returned to Iceland fought his foes and was
defeated, but finally succeeded, by the backing of friends, in
effecting a reconciliation with them. He spent the winter in Iceland,
and sailed the following spring for Greenland, where he settled at a
place called Brattahlid (Steep Lea) in Ericsfirth. Thirty-five
ship-loads of people followed him, but only fourteen arrived safely.
The remainder were shipwrecked, or driven back to Iceland.</p>

<p>The interest now shifts from Eric to his son, Leif the Lucky, who
becomes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span> the hero of the Saga. Sixteen years after his
father's settlement in Greenland, Leif, as behooved the son of a
chieftain, equipped a ship and set out to see the world, and gather
fortune and experience. He must then have been between twenty and
twenty-five years old. He arrived in Drontheim, Norway, in the autumn,
and met there King Olaf Tryggveson. The king, who had been baptized in
England, was full of zeal for the Christian faith, and was employing
every means in his power to christianize the country. But the
peasantry, who were worshippers of Odin and Thor, refused to listen to
him, and even compelled him to eat horse-flesh and participate in
pagan rites. Under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at
that he took kindly to the handsome young Icelander who displayed such
an interest in the new religion, and listened attentively while the
king expounded the faith to him. For Leif was a courteous and
intelligent man, of fine presence, good address, and indomitable
spirit. The king, says the Saga, "thought him a man of great
accomplishments." It was not long before he concluded to accept
Christianity, whereupon he was baptized, with all his shipmates. King
Olaf then charged him to return to Iceland and induce the people to
abandon idolatry and accept the true faith. Leif, knowing how deeply
attached the Icelanders were to their old gods, was very reluctant to
undertake this mission, but finally yielded to the king's persuasions,
"provided the king would grant him the grace of his protection."</p>

<p>He accordingly put to sea; but encountered heavy weather and was
driven out of his course. For a long while he was tossed about by the
tempest, until he came upon "lands of which he had previously no
knowledge. There were self-sown wheat-fields and vines growing there.
There were also those trees which are called <i>masur</i> (maples?). And of
all these things they took samples."</p>

<p>The other version to which I have alluded is much more explicit, and
recounts how Leif went to Greenland to visit his father, Eric the Red,
and how there he heard the account of Bjarne Herjulfson's voyage, and
of the unknown lands to the westward which he professed to have seen.
The people, we read, blamed Bjarne for his lack of enterprise in
failing to explore the territories of which he had caught glimpses,
"so as to be able to bring some report of them." Leif, being of an
adventurous spirit, was fired by this talk, and resolved to accomplish
what the incurious Bjarne had left undone. He gathered together a crew
of thirty-five men, and invited his father to command the expedition.
Eric at first declined, saying that he was well stricken in years, and
unable to endure the exposure of such a voyage. Leif insisted,
however, that "he would be most apt to bring good luck," and the old
man, yielding to his son's solicitation, mounted his horse and rode
forth at the head of the ship-crew. But when he was nearing the beach,
the horse stumbled and Eric was thrown and wounded his foot. This was
held to be a bad omen, and as he was trying to rise, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is not destined that I shall discover any more lands than the one
in which we are now living; nor can we now continue longer together."</p>

<p>Leif, knowing persuasion to be vain, pursued his way alone, and
embarked with his thirty-five shipmates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051"></a>(p. 051)</span> "When they were ready, they sailed out to sea and found first
that land which Bjarne and his shipmates found last."</p>

<p>It is not stated how long they had been at sea when this land was
found. The account goes on as follows:</p>

<p>"They sailed up to the land and cast anchor, and launched a boat and
went ashore, and saw no grass there. Great ice mountains lay inland,
back from the sea, and it was as a [table land of] flat rocks all the
way from the sea to the ice mountains; and the country seemed to them
to be entirely devoid of good qualities. Then said Leif: 'It has not
come to pass with us in regard to this land as with Bjarne, that we
have not gone upon it. To this country I will now give a name and call
it Helluland' (<i>i.e.</i>, The Land of Flat Rocks).</p>

<p>"They returned to the ship and put out to sea, and found a second
land. They sailed again to the land, came to anchor, launched a boat,
and went ashore. This was a level wooded land, and there were broad
stretches of white sand, where they went, and the land was level by
the sea. Then said Leif: 'This land shall have a name according to its
nature, and we will call it Markland' (<i>i.e.</i>, Wood Land). They
returned to the ship forthwith and sailed away upon the main, with
northeast winds, and were out two 'doegr' before they sighted land.
They sailed toward this land and came to an island which lay to the
northward off the land. There they went ashore and looked about them,
the weather being fine, and they observed that there was dew upon the
grass; and it so happened that they touched the dew with their hands,
and touched their hands to their mouths; and it seemed to them that
they had never tasted anything so sweet as this. They went aboard
their ship again, and sailed into a certain sound, which lay between
the island and a cape which jutted out from the land on the north, and
they stood in westering past the cape. At ebb-tide there were broad
stretches of shallow water there, and they ran their ship aground; and
it was a long distance from the ship to the ocean. Yet were they so
anxious to go ashore that they could not wait until the tide should
rise under their ship, but hastened to the land, where a certain river
flows out from a lake. As soon as the tide rose beneath their ship,
however, they took the boat and rowed to the ship, which they towed up
the river, and then into the lake, where they cast anchor and carried
their hammocks ashore, and built themselves booths there. They
afterward determined to establish themselves there for the winter, and
they accordingly built a large house. There was no lack of salmon
either in the river or in the lake, and larger salmon than they had
ever seen before. The country thereabouts seemed to be possessed of
such good qualities that cattle would need no fodder there during the
winter. There was no frost there during the winter, and the grass
withered but little. The days and the nights were of more nearly equal
length than in Greenland or Iceland."</p>

<p>Now follows an account of the exploring parties which Leif sent out,
some of which he joined, while at other times he remained behind to
guard the house. Here occurs, with curious abruptness, this graphic
bit of characterization: "Leif <span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052"></a>(p. 052)</span> was a large and powerful man,
and of most imposing bearing, a man of sagacity, and a very just man
in all things."</p>

<p>A very pretty incident is now related of the German Tyrker, who had
been one of the thralls of Eric the Red, and of whom Leif was very
fond. It was the custom in the households of Norse chiefs to give
children into the special charge of a trusted thrall, who was then
styled the child's foster-father. Sometimes the thrall was presented
to the child as a "tooth-gift," <i>i.e.</i>, in commemoration of its
cutting its first tooth.</p>

<p>"It was discovered one evening that one of their company was missing;
and this proved to be Tyrker, the German. Leif was sorely troubled by
this; for Tyrker had lived with Leif and his father for a long time,
and had been very devoted to Leif when he was a child. Leif severely
reprimanded his companions and prepared to go in search of him. They
had proceeded but a short distance from the house when they were met
by Tyrker, whom they received most cordially. Leif observed at once
that his foster-father was in lively spirits.... Leif addressed him
and asked: 'Wherefore art thou so belated, foster-father mine, and
astray from the others?'</p>

<p>"In the beginning Tyrker spoke for some time in German, rolling his
eyes, and grinning, and they could not understand him. But after a
time he addressed them in the Norse tongue.</p>

<p>"'I did not go much farther [than you]; yet I have something novel to
relate. I have found grapes and vines.'</p>

<p>"'Is this indeed true, foster-father?' asked Leif.</p>

<p>"'Of a certainty it is true' replied he; 'for I was born where there
is no lack of either grapes or vines.'</p>

<p>"They slept the night through, and on the morrow Leif said to his
shipmates:</p>

<p>"'We will now divide our labors; and each day will either gather
grapes, or cut vines, or fell trees, so as to obtain a cargo of these
for my ship.'</p>

<p>"They acted upon this advice, and it is said that their after-boat was
filled with grapes. A cargo sufficient for the ship was cut, and when
the spring came they made their ship ready and sailed away. And from
its products Leif gave the land a name and called it Wineland.</p>

<p>"They sailed out to sea and had fair winds until they sighted
Greenland, and the fells below the glacier; then one of the men spoke
up and said: 'Why do you steer the ship so close to the wind?' Leif
answered: 'I have my mind upon my steering and upon other matters as
well. Do you not see anything out of the common?' They replied that
they saw nothing unusual. 'I do not know,' says Leif, 'whether it is a
ship or a skerry that I see.' Now they saw it, and said that it must
be a skerry. But he was so much more sharp-sighted than they, that he
was able to discern men upon the skerry. 'I think it best to tack,'
says Leif, 'so that we may draw near to them and be able to render
them assistance, if they stand in need of it. And if they should not
be peaceably disposed, we shall have better command of the situation
than they.'</p>

<img src="images/img025.jpg" width="600" height="390" alt="" title="">
<p>Leif Ericson off the Coast of Vineland.</p></div>

<p>"They approached the skerry, and lowering their sail, cast anchor and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span> launched a second small boat, which they had brought with
them. Tyrker inquired who was the leader of the party. He replied that
his name was Thare, and that he was a Norwegian. 'But what is thy
name?' Leif gave his name. 'Art thou a son of Eric the Red, of
Brattahlid?' says he. Leif replied that he was. 'It is now my wish,'
Leif continued, 'to take you all into my ship, and likewise as much of
your possessions as the ship will hold.'</p>

<p>"This offer was accepted, and [with their ship] thus laden, they held
their course toward Ericsfirth, and sailed until they arrived at
Brattahlid. Having discharged his cargo, Leif invited Thare, with his
wife, Gudrid, and three others to make their home with him, and
procured quarters for the other members of the crew, both for his own
and Thare's men. Leif rescued fifteen men from the skerry. He was from
that time forth called Leif the Lucky."</p>

<p>The time of Leif's voyage to Wineland has been fixed at 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> For
we learn that it took place while Olaf Tryggveson (995-1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) was
king in Norway; and scarcely less than four or five years could have
elapsed since Leif's first meeting with the king in Drontheim, shortly
after the death of his predecessor, Earl Hakon.</p>

<p>The remainder of the Saga of Eric the Red is occupied with an account
of the successive Wineland voyages of Thorwald Ericson, the brother of
Leif, Thorfinn Karlsefne, and of Leif's sister, Freydis, who was as
quarrelsome, proud, and pugnacious as her father. The Indians (called
by the Norsemen Skrellings), who had failed to disturb Leif, made
demonstrations of hostility against Thorfinn Karlsefne, and after the
loss of several of his men, compelled him to abandon the attempt at a
permanent settlement.</p>

<p>The tradition of these Wineland voyages continued, however, to be
transmitted from generation to generation in Iceland, and in the early
part of the fourteenth century was committed to writing.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the saga to which I have referred was not written
primarily with a view to establish Leif's claim to be the discoverer
of Wineland. In the first place the story, in the shape in which we
have it, is more than a century and a half older than the Columbian
discovery, and there could, accordingly, be no great glory in having
found a country which had since been lost. Secondly, the saga is (like
most Icelandic sagas) a family chronicle, purporting to relate all
matters of interest pertaining to the race of Eric the Red. The
Wineland voyages are treated as remarkable incidents in this
chronicle, but they hardly occupy any more space than properly belongs
to them in a family history which is concerned with a great many other
things besides. The importance of this as corroborating the
authenticity of the narrative, can scarcely be over-estimated.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span> HAROLD, KING OF ENGLAND<br>

(1022-1066)</h3>

<a id="img026" name="img026"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img026.jpg" width="300" height="222" alt="Harold, King of England." title="">
</div>

<p>Harold II., the last of the native English kings, was the second son
of Earl Godwin by his Danish wife Gytha, the sister of Earl Ulf, and
was born about 1022. At an early age he was made Earl of the East
Angles and he shared his father's outlawry in 1051, finding a refuge
in Ireland. Next year, together with his brother Leofwin, he crossed
the Channel with nine ships, defeated the men of Somerset and Devon at
Porlock, and ravaged the country, next joined his father at Portland,
and shared the triumph of his return. Harold was at once restored to
his earldom, and next year (1053) succeeded to his father's earldom of
the West Saxons. Henceforward he was the right hand of King Edward,
and still more after the deaths of the old Earls Leofric and Siward,
he directed the whole affairs of the kingdom, with an unusual union of
gentleness and vigor. His brother Tostig succeeded Siward as Earl of
the Northumbrians in 1055, and two years later two other brothers were
raised to earldoms: Gurth to that of the East Anglians, Leofwin to one
formed out of Essex, Kent, and the other shires round about London.
Meantime Harold drove back the Welsh marauders of King Griffith out of
Herefordshire, and added that post of danger to his earldom. The death
in 1057 of the Ætheling Edward, the son of Edmund Ironside, who had
been brought back from Hungary as heir to the throne, opened up the
path for Harold's ambition, and from this time men's eyes rested on
him as their future king. And nature had equalled fortune in her
kindness, for his handsome and stalwart figure and his gentle and
conciliatory temper were kingly qualities that sat well upon his
sagacity, his military skill, and his personal courage. Harold's
policy throughout was thoroughly English, contrary to the predominant
French influences that had governed the early part of Edward's reign.
He was English in everything, even to his preference for secular
priests to monks. He made his pilgrimage to Rome in 1058, and after
his return completed his church at Waltham, known later as Waltham
Abbey. In 1063, provoked by the fresh incursions of Griffith, he
marched against him, and by making his men put off their heavy armor
and weapons, and adopt the Welshmen's own tactics, he was able to
traverse the whole country, and beat <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span> the enemy at every
point. Griffith was killed by his own people, whereupon Harold gave
the government to the dead king's brothers, Bleddyn and Rhiwallon, who
swore oaths of fealty both to King Edward and to himself.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say exactly at what date occurred that famous
visit of Harold to the court of Duke William, in Normandy, of the
results of which the Norman writers make so much, although with many
contradictions, while the English writers, with the most marked and
careful unanimity, say nothing at all. It seems most likely that
Harold did make some kind of oath to William, most probably under
compulsion, when he had fallen into his hands after being shipwrecked
on the coast of Ponthieu, and imprisoned by its Count Guy. Mr. Freeman
thinks the most probable date to be 1064. It is at least certain that
Harold helped William in a war with the Bretons, and in the Bayeux
tapestry we see his stalwart form lifting up two Normans at once when
they were in danger of being swept away by the river Coesnon, which
divides Normandy from Brittany. The Norman writers make Harold
formally swear fealty to William, promising to marry one of his
daughters, and we are told that additional sanctity was given to this
oath by its being made upon a chest full of the most sacred relics.</p>

<p>In 1065, the Northumbrians rebelled against the rule of Tostig, and
Harold found himself compelled, between policy and a sense of justice,
to side with them, and to acquiesce in their choice of Morcar and the
banishment of Tostig. At the beginning of 1066 King Edward died, his
last breath being to recommend that Harold should be chosen king. He
was crowned on January 6th, and at once set himself with steadfast
energy to consolidate his kingdom. At York he won over the reluctant
men of Northumbria, and he next married Ealdgyth, Griffith's widow, in
order to secure the alliance of her brothers, Morcar and Edwin. His
short reign of forty weeks and one day was occupied with incessant
vigilance against the attacks of two formidable enemies at once. Duke
William lost no time in beginning his preparations for the invasion of
England, and Tostig, after trying the Normans and the Scots, and
filibustering along the coasts on his own account, succeeded in
drawing to his side the famous Harold Hardrada, king of Norway. In the
month of September the two reached the Humber, and Harold marched to
meet them, resting neither day nor night. The Icelandic historian,
Snorro, in his dramatic narrative of the fight, tells how Harold rode
out accompanied with twenty of his housecarls to have speech with Earl
Tostig, and offer him peace; and when asked what amends King Hardrada
should have for his trouble in coming, replied, "Seven feet of the
ground of England, or more perchance, seeing he is taller than other
men." At Stamford Bridge Harold overtook his enemy, and after a bloody
struggle won a complete victory (September 25, 1066), both Tostig and
Harold Hardrada being among the slain. But four days later Duke
William landed at Pevensey. Harold marched southward with the utmost
haste, bringing with him the men of Wessex and East Anglia, and the
earldoms of his brothers; but the two earls, Edwin and Morcar, held
aloof and kept back the men of the north, although some of the men of
Mercia, in the earldom of Edwin, followed their king to the fatal
struggle which was fought out <span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span> from nine in the morning till
past nightfall, on October 14, 1066. The English fought with the most
stubborn courage, and the battle was only lost by their allowing the
pretended flight of the Normans to draw them from their impregnable
position on the crest of the hill, ringed with an unbroken shield
wall. On its slope, right in front of the Norman army, waved the
golden dragon of Wessex, as well as the king's own standard, a
fighting man wrought upon it in gold. Here Harold stood with his
mighty two-handed axe, and hewed down the Normans as they came. Before
nightfall he fell, pierced through the eye with an arrow. His
housecarls fought where they stood till they fell one by one; his
brothers, Gurth and Leofwin, died beside him. The king's body was
found upon the field, recognized only by a former mistress, the fair
Eadgyth Swanneshals ("Edith of the swan's neck").</p>

<p>At first, William ordered it to be buried on the rocks at Hastings,
but seems after to have permitted it to be removed to Harold's own
church at Waltham. Than Harold, no braver or more heroic figure ever
filled a throne; no king ever fought more heroically for his crown. If
he failed, it was because he had to bow his head to fate, and in his
death he saved all the honor of his family and his race. His tragic
story has given a subject for a romance to Lytton, and for a stately
drama to Tennyson.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>THE CID<br>

By <span class="smcap">Henry G. Hewlett</span><br>

(1026-1099)</h3>

<a id="img028" name="img028"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img028.jpg" width="250" height="282" alt="The Cid." title="">
</div>

<p>The narratives concerning the life and exploits of the Cid are, to a
great extent, merely poetic. Yet it has been wisely said, that much
which must be rejected as not fact may still be accepted as truth;
that is, there is often to be found under the husks of legend and
myth, a sound kernel of historical reality. This may be the case with
respect to the Cid, who probably was a warrior so remarkable for
genius or bravery above his fellows that he gathered up in a single
fame the reputation of many others, with whose deeds he was credited,
and whom, as a class, he accordingly represents in history.</p>

<p>Spain, long one of the most flourishing provinces of the Roman Empire,
was among the first to fall under the sway of the Visigoths, a warlike
but enlightened race, which soon embraced Christianity. For three
centuries the country <span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span> remained under Gothic rule, but
fell, in 712, by the invasion of the Arabian conquerors of Africa&mdash;a
remnant of Christians only preserving an independent monarchy in the
mountains of Asturia. This little seed of freedom grew and bore fruit.
France proved a formidable barrier against further invasion; and in
Spain itself internal jealousies among the Arab families weakened the
Moslem and strengthened the Christian power. In the eleventh century
there were several states in Spain wholly unfettered by a foreign
yoke. The enmity between the two races and creeds was bitter, and war
raged perpetually. Yet it often happened that, at the prompting of
private revenge or family quarrels, alliances were made between
kingdoms thus naturally opposed to each other. A recollection of this
fact is essential to a clear understanding of Spanish history at this
period.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the eleventh century the chief Christian states
of Spain became, through divers marriages, united under one king,
Sancho, who died in 1034 dividing his territories among his three
sons: of whom Garcia took Navarre, Ferdinand, Castile, and Ramirez,
Aragon. Leon, the remaining Christian monarchy, was ruled by Bermudez
III., whose sister Ferdinand of Castile had married. Just as this
apparent junction of interest occurred among the warriors of the
Cross, the greatest confusion prevailed among those of the Crescent.
The mighty house of the Ommiades&mdash;perhaps the most illustrious of the
factions into which the successors of the Prophet were divided&mdash;no
longer commanded the allegiance of the Arabs of Spain. Its last prince
fled, and the chief cities fell into the hands of independent lords,
who constituted themselves petty Emirs in their own dominions.
Instead, however, of taking full advantage of this state of anarchy to
extend their united power, the Christian kings weakened each other by
unnatural and deadly quarrels. Ferdinand, King of Castile, seems to
have been the principal aggressor. His great captain in his wars, both
with Moslem and Christian states, was Rodrigo Laynez, who was called
also by the Spaniards Ruy Diaz de Rivar, from the name of his
birthplace, and by the Arabs <i>El Sayd</i> (Lord), which has been altered
into Cid. He was probably born about the year 1026, or rather later,
at the Castle of Rivar, near Burgos, in Old Castile, of a noble but
not wealthy family. He joined the army of Ferdinand, and rose by his
talents, strength, and courage to the highest place in that king's
service. Among the romantic stories told of his early career is one
concerning his marriage, which forms the subject of a popular ballad.
The father of Rodrigo, having been injured by a Count Gomez, the young
knight defied the latter to a duel and slew him. The count's daughter,
Ximena, in a storm of grief and rage, flew to the king, and cried for
vengeance on Rodrigo, who met her face to face, and awaited the result
of her entreaties.</p>

<p>No one, however, was hardy enough to offer himself as the damsel's
champion against so doughty a warrior, and Rodrigo calmly retired. His
manly bearing and fame won him a place in the very heart which he had
so deeply offended; and, with truly Spanish impetuosity, Ximena gave
him, not only pardon, but love. She again repaired to the king and
asked leave to bestow her hand upon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span> the knight, urging the
curious plea that she foresaw he would one day be the most powerful
subject in the realm. Informed of this request, of which the king
approved, Rodrigo consented to the marriage, as an act of obedience to
his sovereign and of justice to the lady. The meeting of this
strangely matched pair is thus described in the ballad (Lockhart's
translation):</p>

<p class="poem10">
  "But when the fair Ximena came forth to plight her hand,<br>
  Rodrigo, gazing on her, his face could not command:<br>
  He stood, and blushed before her: thus at the last said he,<br>
  'I slew thy sire, Ximena, but not in villany:<br>
  In no disguise I slew him; man against man I stood;<br>
  There was some wrong between us, and I did shed his blood:<br>
  I slew a man; I owe a man; fair lady, by God's grace,<br>
  An honored husband shalt thou have in thy dead father's place.'"</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that this charming story is supposed to have but
little foundation in fact. Many of Rodrigo's legendary exploits are
still less authentic; but history and fable unite in declaring him a
warrior of no common stamp. His master, King Ferdinand, as we have
said, invaded the territories of his brothers and friends, besides
those of his enemies. Garcia, Ramirez, and Bermudez successively fell
before his attacks, which Rodrigo, in the true spirit of knightly
obedience to his lord, did not hesitate to lead. Sancho, the king's
eldest son, was Rodrigo's most intimate friend; and on the accession
of the prince to his father's throne on the death of Ferdinand, in
1065, Rodrigo became Campeador (or, as the Arabs call him, <i>El
Cambitur</i>); that is, head of the army. The new king followed in his
father's courses of injustice, and drove his brother, Alfonso, King of
Leon, into exile.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img029.jpg" width="400" height="582" alt="" title="">
<p>The Cid ordering the Execution of Ahmed.</p></div>

<p>In 1072 Sancho besieged Zamora, which one of his sisters, whom he had
likewise despoiled, held out against him. The king was killed during
the siege, and, as it was suspected, by the agency of his exiled
brother, Alfonso, who succeeded to the throne. Rodrigo felt his
friend's death deeply, and did not scruple to avow his suspicions of
Alfonso. Before promising allegiance, the Campeador insisted that the
king should cleanse himself by an oath of the accusation which popular
rumor had brought against him. To this Alfonso, whether innocent or
guilty, not unnaturally demurred; but the powerful warrior was firm,
and the king at last yielded. When the appointed day arrived, Alfonso
made his appearance, surrounded by his courtiers, all obsequiously
vying in praise of his glory and virtue, and contemptuous
denunciations of his daring accuser. Rodrigo stood alone and gazed on
the king sternly. Some of the nobles endeavored to dissuade him from
holding this attitude of opposition, and to induce him to forego the
demand which he had made; but he put them aside and repeated his
challenge. Alfonso dared not refuse to accept, and accordingly recited
aloud the form of oath prescribed on such occasions, affirming, in the
presence of his maker and the saints of heaven, that he was guiltless
of the death of his brother. He had no sooner concluded than all eyes
were turned upon the Cid, who, in deep, solemn tones, and with the
most impressive earnestness of manner, imprecated <span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span> on the
head of his king every curse that heaven or hell could inflict, if, in
taking that oath, he had committed perjury. The awed assembly then
broke up. Rodrigo, from that hour, was hated by the king and shunned
by the court.</p>

<p>Yet, aware of the Cid's value, Alfonso seems to have concealed his
resentment for some time, and even endeavored to win the affection of
his great subject by allying him in marriage with one of the royal
family. Rodrigo's wife was now dead, and he consented to marry the
princess proposed to him, whose name was also Ximena. The marriage
took place in 1074. It had not the effect, however, of uniting the
king and the Cid. After having achieved a brilliant success over the
Arabs of Granada, who were at war with two other Moslem states in
alliance with Castile, and having signalized his humanity by releasing
all his prisoners, the great Campeador was disgraced and banished by
his ungrateful master. At the court of the Emir of Saragossa the exile
found a ready welcome, and was appointed to a high post in the
government of the kingdom. He did not bear arms against his own
sovereign, but headed the Arabs in several battles with the Christians
of Aragon and other states. The invasion of a Moorish host in Spain,
under the eminent Caliph Jusef Ben Taxfin, chief of the Almoravides
and conqueror of Morocco; the rapid subjugation of the independent
Emirs, and the defeat of Alfonso's army at the battle of Zalaka, in
1087, recalled the Castilians to a sense of Rodrigo's worth. He was
invited to return by Alfonso, and with great generosity consented,
bringing with him a large body of men raised by his own exertion and
cost. For two years he made his name terrible to the Moors, as the
great Christian champion.</p>

<p>But even this fame was not sufficient to secure his influence at
court, and about the year 1090 he was once more banished, and his
estates were seized. He appears from this time to have commenced a
life of adventurous and independent warfare with the Moors. He
besieged Alcocer, a strong Moorish fortress on the borders of Aragon,
and finally took it. With a band of determined warriors of his own
stamp he ravaged, consumed, and spoiled all the Moslem territories
which he invaded, making a castle on a rock in Ternel his chief
stronghold, and thence sallying out in forays. The place has been ever
since called the Rock of the Cid.</p>

<p>The last and greatest achievement of this hero was the taking of
Valencia. This city was in the hands of a Moslem prince, Alcadir by
name, who had refused to acknowledge the authority of Jusef and the
Almoravides over Spain, which they were attempting to subdue. The Cid,
either as an ally of Alcadir, or from motives of policy, assisted him
in the defence of the city; but it was taken through the treachery of
its Cadi, Ahmed. For this service, the traitor was made governor in
the room of Alcadir, who fell fighting bravely. A kinsman of the
betrayed king determined to avenge his death, and asked the Cid's aid,
which was promptly given. The Arabian historians relate that Ahmed
yielded after a brief siege, on conditions of safety for himself and
family. It is further related that this promise was faithlessly
broken, and the guilty Ahmed sentenced by Rodrigo to be burned alive
for his crimes. The Christian historians happily acquit <span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span> the
Cid's memory of this barbarity; but all unite in recording the
successful siege of the city, which he took in 1094. While he lived,
the Moors vainly tried to retake it; but on his death, which is
supposed to have occurred in 1099, Valencia again fell. Romance has
colored with glowing tints this scanty historic outline of the Cid's
life. Spanish literature, for two or three hundred years after his
death, is almost confined to epic or ballad poetry, of which he is the
hero. To acquire such a fame demanded a force of character, which, if
not accurately painted by these loving and fanciful narrators, cannot
have fallen far short of the glory with which the world will forever
associate the name of the Cid Campeador.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>


<h3>ST. BERNARD<br>

By <span class="smcap">Henry G. Hewlett</span><br>

(1091-1153)</h3>

</div>

<p>In 1091, when the career of the Cid was drawing to a close in Spain, a
yet greater Christian champion was born in France; greater, if only in
this, that the weapons of his warfare were not carnal. That the work
was good in itself, we think will be clear from a perusal of the life
of the warrior-monk, St. Bernard.</p>

<p>His birthplace was Fontaines, near Dijon, in Burgundy; his father,
Tecelin, a knight of honorable reputation, and so absorbed in his
profession that he was compelled to leave the care of his seven sons,
of whom Bernard was the third, to his wife Aleth. She was a pious and
gentle woman, strictly attached to the duties of religion, and anxious
for the spiritual rather than the temporal welfare of her children,
whom she therefore devoted to the cloister. A dream, it is said, had
indicated to her the future fame of her third son, before his birth.
He rapidly displayed signs of possessing no ordinary character. His
education was undertaken by the then celebrated school of Chantillon
and the University of Paris, where he remained some years, actively
pursuing his studies. His mother died soon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061"></a>(p. 061)</span> after his return
home, and he then proceeded to fulfil her wish, which accorded with
his own, of becoming a monk. His father and friends endeavored to
dissuade him from this step, but instead, he persuaded five of his
brothers and twenty-five other friends to join him in the career which
he had chosen. His father and remaining brothers subsequently followed
him, and the whole family took monastic vows. Bernard did not select
for his abode one of those monasteries whose wealth and splendor had
corrupted the intention of their founders, and softened the severity
of the original discipline. His motive was truly religious, and took
the superstitious form then almost inseparable from earnest piety. He
and his comrades entered the poor convent of Citeaux, near Dijon,
where the rules of life enjoined by St. Benedict in the sixth century
were observed with great rigor. Frequent watchings, fasts, bleedings,
and scourgings, for the purpose of mortifying the body; abstinence
from conversation or laughter; habits of perpetual devotion, laborious
exertion, and humble obedience to the abbot, were the main features of
the system. Bernard undertook the duties of his office with such
incessant zeal, and displayed such amazing control over his appetites,
that he seriously weakened his health, but at the same time enlarged
his reputation to such an extent that the convent became overcrowded
with the number of those whom he had attracted thither. He was
therefore appointed, after three years' residence at Citeaux, to head
a colony of monks which was to be fixed in the valley of Clairvaux&mdash;a
desolate though beautiful spot in the bishopric of Langres. The tears
of their brethren accompanied the departure of Bernard and the twelve
others who composed the band. It was in the year 1115, and at the age
of twenty-six, that he was made Abbot of Clairvaux. His appearance at
the consecration is described as that of a corpse rather than a man,
so emaciated with the rigors of devotion had he become. He had
frequent visions, perhaps from his weakness, in one of which he
imagined that the Virgin Mary herself appeared to him. The privations
of the members of his little colony were most severe. The season for
sowing had been spent in building the convent, and when the winter
came they were reduced to little better than starvation. Coarse bread
and beech-leaves steeped in salt were their only food. This scanty
sustenance, together with the strict adherence to the Benedictine
rule, in which Bernard still persisted, so shattered his health, that
the bishop of the diocese, who was his personal friend, at last
interfered, and released him from the active duties of abbot. But as
soon as a brief respite had restored his strength, Bernard renewed his
self-mortifying practices. A fresh attack of illness followed, and he
was obliged permanently to relax his habits. In after-years he
lamented the error into which his early enthusiasm and mistaken zeal
had led him, the effects of which greatly marred his future influence
for good.</p></div>

<p>Though debarred from laboring in his own sphere, Bernard's energetic
mind would not let him rest, and he began from this time to exercise
the power which his reputation for sanctity had brought him, in
political life. He well knew the nature of the position which he was
thus enabled to take, and did not shrink from its perils. "Bernard!
wherefore art thou here on earth?" is said to have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062"></a>(p. 062)</span> been his
constant self-appeal. Poor and unarmed, a priest or monk in those days
had nothing wherewith to oppose the tyranny of the powerful nobility,
save the weapons of religion and intellect. How righteously they could
be used we shall see in the case of Bernard. In repeated instances he
interposed the weight of his authority between the anger of a king or
noble and the weakness of a subject or tenant, and scarcely ever
failed in his object. One of the most remarkable examples of this kind
was his conduct toward the Count of Aquitaine. This nobleman, a man of
immense strength of will no less than body, and violent and despotic
beyond his fellows, having espoused the cause of one rival Pope
against another, dismissed from their sees several excellent bishops
in his territory who were adverse to his views, and supplied their
places without regard to fitness of character. Bernard, having twice
remonstrated in vain, after the last interview held a solemn mass in
the church near the count's castle, at which that nobleman, as
excommunicated, could not be present, but stood outside. The
consecration of the wafer was duly performed, and the blessing
bestowed upon the people, when Bernard suddenly made his way through
the crowd, bearing in his hand the Host on its paten (or plate), and
confronted the astonished count as he stood at the church door amid
his soldiery. With pale, stern face, and flashing eyes, the daring
monk thus addressed the haughty chief: "Twice have the Lord's servants
entreated you, and you have despised them. Lo! now the blessed Son of
the Virgin&mdash;the Head and Lord of that Church which you
persecute&mdash;appears to you! Behold your Judge, to whom your soul must
be rendered! Will you reject Him like His servants?" A hush of awe and
expectation among the bystanders followed these words, broken by a
groan from the conscience-stricken count, whose imagination was filled
with such lively terror of Divine wrath that he fell fainting to the
ground. Though raised up by his men, he again fell speechless.
Bernard, seizing the opportunity, called to his side one of the
deposed bishops, and on the count's recovery ordered that the kiss of
reconciliation should be bestowed, and the exile restored. The effect
of this scene was not transient, for the proud spirit had been subdued
in the count's heart, and he performed penance for his offences by
going on pilgrimage.</p>

<a id="img031" name="img031"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img031.jpg" width="600" height="306" alt="" title="">
<p>The Vision of St. Bernard.</p></div>

<p>Various other instances of Bernard's boldness in rebuking kings,
nobles, and even Popes, might be adduced. His most remarkable
appearance as a political peace-maker was in the dispute which took
place after the death of Pope Honorius II., as to the succession to
the popedom. Two rival factions at Rome contended for the claims of
separate candidates: one a wealthy and worldly, the other a learned
and pious, cardinal. Bernard, as we may suppose, supported the cause
of the latter, who took the name of Innocent II. At the council of
Etampes, where Louis VI. of France and his nobles were assembled, the
monk's eloquence prevailed over all the arguments of diplomacy, and
the influence of France was pledged to the side of Innocent. Bernard
next engaged aid from Henry I., of England, and Lothaire, the Emperor
of Germany. He then proceeded to Milan, where the party of the rival
Pope, Anaclete, and his supporter, Conrad, Duke of Suabia, Lothaire's
antagonist, was strongest. Bernard's fame <span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span> was so great,
and the imaginations of those who beheld him so fascinated by his
force of will, that on his way the sick were carried forth to meet
him, and numerous miracles were said to be wrought by the touch of his
garments. In Milan, through his eloquence, Anaclete's party was
completely vanquished, and the Milanese so impressed that they offered
to displace their archbishop in Bernard's favor. But on this and other
occasions he steadily refused any such rank, content to live and die
in a sphere where he could be more useful, if less exalted. He
returned to France, after a lengthened absence, in 1135, meeting on
his way with a royal reception.</p>

<p>He was once more absorbed in the duties of his office, as Abbot of
Clairvaux, when again summoned to Italy by Innocent II., to oppose the
power of Roger, the Norman King of Sicily, whose aid Anaclete had
obtained. Bernard first passed into Germany, and successfully mediated
between the emperor and the Suabian princes, inducing the latter to
relinquish their rebellion. Lothaire was then prevailed upon to aid
Innocent by force of arms, while Bernard proceeded to employ force of
intellect in the same service. He first won over by his arguments many
of Anaclete's chief supporters, and then accepted a challenge which
King Roger threw out, to dispute publicly in the Court of Salerno as
to the claims of the rival Popes, with Anaclete's champion, Cardinal
Pietro di Pisa. At this public contest Bernard not only confuted, but
converted, the cardinal, and reconciled him to Innocent. With Roger,
Bernard was not so successful, and a battle ensued between the armies
of the contending Popes. Innocent was captured, but contrived to make
favorable terms with Roger; and a peace was agreed to, which was
finally ratified by the death of Anaclete, in 1138. Another anti-pope
having been set up, Bernard used his personal influence with the
pretender, and induced him to yield. Thus the schism in the Church was
healed, and the good abbot returned to Clairvaux.</p>

<p>In 1146 he was mainly instrumental in promoting the second crusade.
News reached Europe that, two years before, the Christian state of
Edessa (which, as we have already seen, was founded by Baldwin,
brother of Godfrey de Bouillon) had, through the weakness of its
government, fallen into the hands of the Sultan of Bagdad, and
Jerusalem was again in peril. Inflamed with enthusiasm, Bernard
stirred up the hearts of his countrymen to zeal in the cause of the
Cross. Louis VII., of France, was readily persuaded to undertake the
crusade as a penance for his crimes; but the Emperor Conrad, of
Germany, was indisposed to exertion; and to him, therefore, Bernard
hastened, rousing the people of France and Germany as he travelled
through. The frozen reluctance of the monarch could not withstand the
fiery earnestness of the monk. Conrad is said to have dissolved into
tears at the discourse, and eagerly accepted the cross which was
offered. While in Germany Bernard showed his liberality of
thought&mdash;rare in those days&mdash;by sternly rebuking the ignorance of a
monk who was denouncing the Jews as the cause of the recent
calamities. At the council of Vezelay (in Burgundy), held in 1146,
Bernard's eloquence was as exciting in its influence on his hearers as
that of Pope Urban had been on a previous occasion. As the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span>
speaker, at the end of his oration, held up the cross which was to be
the badge of the enterprise, Louis VII. threw himself at the feet of
his subject, and the whole assembly thronged round him, shouting the
old war-cry, "It is God's will!" Bernard distributed to thousands of
eager hands all the crosses which he had brought with him; and finding
these insufficient for the demand, took off the Benedictine robe which
he wore, and tore it into cross-shaped pieces. So impressed were the
chiefs of the crusading army with his power over the people, that at a
subsequent assembly they even offered the command of the expedition to
him&mdash;an unwarlike monk.</p>

<p>He declined the post on the ground of unfitness, but had he accepted
it, the issue of the crusades might have been different from what it
was. His authority would at least have kept in check the discords,
perfidies, and excesses to which he, probably with justice, afterward
attributed the failure of the enterprise. From these causes, together
with a fatal incapacity on the part of the French and German generals,
the second crusade resulted in nothing but the wholesale massacre of
the Christian armies by the Turks. Bernard, who had predicted the
success of the expedition, was deeply distressed at the unfortunate
result; the more as, with great injustice, the weight of popular
indignation fell upon him and seriously damaged his influence. This
disappointment, however, did not discourage him, and only served to
concentrate his attention for the rest of his life on the more
immediate duties of his calling.</p>

<p>These he had never neglected, even while immersed in religious
politics. By advice and example he greatly reformed the discipline of
monastic life. He continually preached in his own convent; and, either
personally or through agents, is said to have founded upward of sixty
monasteries in alliance with Clairvaux. Among them the Hospice of
Mount St. Bernard, in Switzerland, has distinguished itself by loving
deeds worthy of its founder. Bernard was an eminent theologian, both
in theory and practice, and many of his works are extant. They
disclose very forcibly his strong intellect and warm heart. Many of
his opinions were most liberal for his age, and he rejected several
tenets, on which the Roman Catholic Church has since insisted, with a
decision which would have ranked him among heretics had he lived a few
centuries later. He manifested, nevertheless, a want of freedom in his
conduct toward the great Abelard, who in that age represented the true
Protestant spirit of inquiry into the received doctrines of the
Church. Against this daring thinker Bernard unjustifiably employed the
weight of authority which he possessed, to silence what he deemed a
dangerous boldness of opinion. Toward Abelard personally, however, he
displayed nothing but generous and respectful courtesy, even in the
heat of controversy; and it is satisfactory to know that a cordial
interchange of kindly feeling passed between these two eminent men
long before their deaths.</p>

<p>Many of Bernard's wise and good deeds are recorded, which cannot be
noticed here. We may refer to but one, which greatly influenced the
world for centuries after his death; namely, the sanction and aid
which he gave to the establishment of the Knight-Templars, a body of
soldier-priests, who devoted their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span> lives to the preservation
of the Holy Places and the protection of pilgrims. Had they faithfully
adhered to the statutes which he drew up for their conduct, the
exhibition of zeal which they were designed to make might have been as
blessed to Christendom as their arrogance was cursed.</p>

<p>A few years before his death, Bernard had the gratification of seeing
one of his own disciples raised to the papal chair, as Pope Eugenius
III. The new pontiff recognized his master's authority no less than
before his accession, and Bernard's counsel and influence were
repeatedly used in his behalf. But the over-activity of the good abbot
too soon decayed the slender strength which his firm will had wrested,
as it were, from death in a hand-to-hand struggle that lasted for more
than forty years. Always sickly, frequently reduced to the brink of
the grave, yet perpetually at work, his constitution gave way in 1155,
at the age of sixty-three. His last act was worthy of his life. He was
on a dying-bed when a discord broke out between the nobles and the
burghers of the town of Mentz. Bernard rose, and once more entered the
arena of strife with the olive-branch of peace in his hand. The proud
barons and the angry citizens listened humbly to his gentle words, and
shrank from the mild glances of those eyes which his biographers
scarcely ever mention without calling <i>dove-like</i>. The turbulence of
passion was hushed, and Bernard returned to die. The filial tears of
his disciples at Clairvaux, and the regrets of all the nation,
followed him to the grave. About twenty years after his death a decree
of canonization awarded him the title of Saint, which, considering how
it has been disgraced by unholy bearers, will not seem so fitly to
recognize his merit as that name which the reverence of the Church has
further bestowed on him&mdash;the <i>last</i> of the Fathers.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>FREDERICK BARBAROSSA<br>

By <span class="smcap">Lady Lamb</span><br>

(1121-1190)</h3>


<p>It seems almost incredible that no history should exist of the
childhood and early life of an emperor of such note as "Barbarossa;"
yet, in spite of most diligent search, we have been compelled almost
to renounce one of the most pleasing tasks of a biographer, which
consists in making acquaintance with a hero in his infancy, and
through childhood and youth following his career to fame and glory. So
far as we have been able to discover, no trace, except a few dry data,
exists of "Frederick of the Red Beard," until we find him setting out
with his uncle, Conrad III., in the spring of 1147, to join the second
crusade against the Saracens. The date of his birth is given as 1121,
his father being Duke Frederick of Hohenstauffen (surnamed "le
Borgne") and his mother Judith, daughter of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span> Henry the Black,
Duke of Bavaria; opinions are divided on the subject of his
birthplace, some writers mentioning the castle of Veitsberg, near
Ravensburg, others the town of Weiblingen, in Nuremburg; but since the
main interest of his history does not begin until his succession to
the paternal duchy of Swabia, and his departure for the Holy Land in
1147; his marriage with Adelaide, daughter of Theobald, Margrave of
Vohburg, in 1149; and finally his accession to the imperial throne in
1152, we must resign ourselves to silence on the subject of his
earlier years, and take up his history from the death of Conrad III.,
and that monarch's choice of him as a successor, to the exclusion of
his own son.</p>

<a id="img032" name="img032"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img032.jpg" width="500" height="308" alt="Frederick Barbarossa." title="">
</div>

<p>From every possible point of view, Frederick of Hohenstauffen
justified his uncle's choice: endowed with the most brilliant
qualities of heart and mind, he had already earned the suffrages of a
great portion of his new subjects by the manner in which he had
distinguished himself during the above-mentioned campaign in the Holy
Land; moreover, as the son of Frederick of Hohenstauffen and Judith,
daughter of Henry the Black, Duke of Bavaria, Ghibelline by his father
and Guelph on his mother's side, there seemed good ground for the hope
that in him might terminate the differences of the two contending
factions. The election diet was accordingly assembled at Frankfort,
and it being there decided to confirm Conrad's choice and to invest
Frederick with the imperial insignia, he was proclaimed King of the
Romans and of Germany, and anointed at Aix-la-Chapelle on March 5,
1152, the ceremony being performed by Arnoul de Gueldre, Archbishop of
Cologne. Not lightly or eagerly did the new emperor accept these
dignities, but after mature and careful consideration of his capacity
to undertake the responsibility of guiding Germany through shoals and
quicksands which had little <span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span> by little enveloped the fair
countries won three hundred years before by the valiant Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Tidings of ever-recurring disturbances determined Frederick to make an
expedition into Italy, as soon as affairs in Germany would admit of
his absence; but there was much to be done first&mdash;many princes to be
dealt with, who, from different motives viewing his election with
dissatisfaction, would take immediate advantage of his departure to
bring all the horrors of civil war into his dominions. Bavaria, for
example, had been wrested from Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, during
his minority, by Conrad III., and now he conjured Frederick, with
tears and threats, to restore it to him. This, by dint of much
diplomacy, Frederick effected, and the result was that for some years
he gained a stanch ally, instead of a designing enemy.</p>

<p>Having decided this quarrel and several others, into which we need not
enter, Frederick prepared for that first expedition into Italy which,
as we have seen, he had resolved on from the commencement of his
reign.</p>

<p>At the head of a numerous army he passed into Switzerland, and
encamped near the lake of Constance; when, under the banner of Count
von Lenzburg, the inhabitants of the three "cents" or cantons of
Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden came to do homage and offer their feudal
service in the field. At the same time, and while still engaged in
assembling the forces with which to march into Italy, deputies from
the city of Lodi arrived, and throwing themselves at his feet,
besought his interference against the oppressions of the Milanese, who
had declared for Adrian IV., and whose town was indeed the very
hot-bed of the papal faction. The emperor instantly sent letters
commanding the Milanese to make full reparation to their unfortunate
neighbors; but on perusal of his behests they tore the missives in a
thousand pieces, and flung them in the faces of the messengers,
sending back by them as their sole answer an open defiance of his
authority. Enraged at this insolence, Frederick crossed the Alps, but,
too prudent to risk an immediate attack on Milan, strongly fortified
and well garrisoned as it was, he sought rather to weaken it through
the other towns with which it was in league, and accordingly besieged
in turn Rosate, Cairo, and Asti, which all fell into his hands, and
ended with the total demolition of the city of Tortona, which he
reduced to ashes, afterward even levelling the ground upon which it
had stood. This last victory proved the accuracy of Barbarossa's
judgment, as regarded the remainder of the fifteen towns of the
so-called "Lombard League," most of which, intimidated by his
energetic measures, sent ambassadors to do homage on their account. He
now seized the iron crown of Lombardy; was crowned at Pavia and again
at Monza, after which he entered into negotiations with Adrian IV. for
the performance of the coronation ceremony at Rome.</p>

<p>We now come to the second marriage of our hero, when Beatrix, the only
child and heiress of Reinold of Burgundy, became his bride; and an
echo of the old romantic halo which surrounds that incident in
Barbarossa's life reaches us, even in this prosaic age, as we picture
to ourselves the gallant, handsome Frederick riding off with his
trusty knights to deliver the fair heiress of Count Reinold <span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068"></a>(p. 068)</span>
from the gloomy prison in which her uncle, Count William, had confined
her in order to appropriate the rich domains of "Franche-Comté." Over
hill and dale sped the chivalrous band till the grim castle was
reached; a halt was ordered, and an envoy sent to summon Count William
to yield both his fortress and the fair prisoner. At first the count
meditated resistance, but on looking out and investigating the number
of Frederick's followers, he decided to submit, and congratulated
himself on his determination when Frederick's messenger said, on
behalf of his master, that if the castle were not given freely it
would be taken by force, the fair Beatrix released, and her gloomy
prison walls be prevented from hiding any other like iniquity by being
razed to the ground. Prudence, we hear, is the better part of valor,
and evidently Count William shared in the opinion, for we learn that
he promptly let down the drawbridge, over which Frederick and his
followers passed, and whence they presently issued, bearing in their
midst the quondam prisoner, the lovely Beatrix, whose eyes, moist with
tears of gratitude, looked trustingly in the handsome face of her
deliverer. So now, away, away to the old church at Wurtzburg! deck the
streets, ring the bells, bid priests don their vestments and burghers
their best, and fall in merrily with the gay procession that comes to
do honor to Barbarossa and his fair bride!</p>

<p>Thus far the little romance of our emperor and Beatrix; now to return
to the sober and solemn statement of facts. During 1157 and the next
year, Frederick busied himself with a campaign against Poland, and
compelled Boleslaw, the king, to acknowledge the supremacy of the head
of the German Empire, and to take the oath of fealty, barefoot and
with his naked sword hung round his neck; after which he bestowed the
kingdom upon Wladislaw of Bohemia, whom he had appointed regent of the
German states during his absence, and whom he now took this
opportunity to reward. New disputes began to arise between Pope Adrian
and Frederick; and when at Besançon some indiscreet remarks of His
Holiness as to having "conferred the imperial crown" on, and "accorded
it by favor" to Frederick, were mentioned, that monarch waited no
longer, but collected a fresh army, and marched into Italy to chastise
the pontiff, who, on hearing of his approach, and scared at the
prospect of such a calamity, hastened to explain away his words as
best he might. The emperor accepted his excuses, but as he was so far
on the road, determined to attack Milan, whose inhabitants had
increased the anger he already felt for them by rebuilding Tortona
(which, as we know, he had totally destroyed), and expelling the
inhabitants of Lodi from their dwellings for having called him to
mediate on the subject of their wrongs. With 100,000 men (for almost
all of the Lombard cities had, either willingly or by force,
contributed their militia) and 15,000 cavalry, he advanced toward
Milan and laid siege to it. The inhabitants made a most obstinate
resistance, and were at length only vanquished by the impossibility of
finding food for the vast population within the walls. A capitulation
was effected, by which the emperor contented himself with very
moderate conditions, the most severe being that which condemned the
city to the loss of her privileges; but when the chief nobles came to
deliver the keys, barefooted and with every token of humility, he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069"></a>(p. 069)</span> forgot their former insolence, and only required, in return
for his clemency, a renewal of the oath of fealty and their promise to
rebuild the town of Lodi.</p>

<p>To put an end to these ever-recurring disputes Frederick called
together a diet at Roncaglia, to which each of the Italian towns was
commanded to send its representative; the four most learned jurists
from the university of Bologna being also requested to attend, for the
purpose of drawing up a document which should conclusively define the
relations between himself, as head of the empire, and the vassals and
imperial cities of Italy. But when the learned quartet had heard all
the points of dispute, and were in possession of the facts, their
decision gave such almost limitless power to Frederick that several of
the towns, and more especially Milan, refused to abide by it and
prepared for further resistance.</p>

<p>Frederick had not been idle all the time these schisms were raging; on
the contrary, he had made a third expedition to Italy, from which he
had been compelled to return, leaving the flower of his army lying
dead, stricken down with pestilence. The next six years were spent in
settling various disputes and complications which had arisen in
Germany during his absence; in causing his son Henry, a child of only
five years of age, to be crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle; and in keeping
some sort of check on his vassal, Henry the Lion, who, now that he had
increased his power by a marriage with Matilda, daughter of Henry II.
of England, was no unimportant person in the empire, and moreover one
extremely liable to become sulky and unmanageable if he had a chance,
or the smallest grievance to complain of.</p>

<p>The news now spread through Europe of the reconquest of Jerusalem by
Saladin. These tidings effaced every other thought; the new Pope,
Urban, forgot the thunders of the Church which he had been keeping,
like a second sword of Damocles, suspended over Frederick's head; the
emperor buried his resentment; a general peace was concluded, and
Barbarossa, then in his seventieth year, gave the regency of his
dominions to his son Henry, and joyfully taking up the
cross&mdash;accompanied by his son Frederick, the flower of German
chivalry, and an army of 100,000 men&mdash;marched by way of Vienna to
Presburg, and thence through Hungary, Servia, and Roumelia.</p>

<p>Isaac Angelus, the Greek emperor, who had promised to furnish the
German troops with provisions and assist Frederick in all ways, with
the proverbial duplicity of his nation, broke his word, harassed him
on his march, and threw Count von Diez, his ambassador, into prison;
which treachery greatly incensed the emperor, and caused him to give
permission to his soldiers to plunder; the results being that the
country soon bore sad traces of their passage, and that the two
important towns of Manioava and Philippopolis were completely
destroyed. This reduced Isaac, professedly, to a state of contrition;
and when Barbarossa advanced toward Constantinople, the Greek emperor,
anxious to conciliate him, placed his entire fleet at his disposal for
the transport of the German army. Scarcely had they entered Asia Minor
before Isaac's good resolutions abandoned him, and leaguing himself
with another faithless ally of Frederick, the Sultan of Iconium, they
beset the German troops, and did everything they possibly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span>
could to make the march more difficult; however, though they tried
both fair means and foul, their evil practices resulted in their own
defeat, and the Oriental Christians soon found they had every reason
to congratulate themselves upon the arrival of such a champion.</p>

<p>The fanaticism of a Turkish prisoner, who, acting as guide, wilfully
sacrificed his life in order to mislead Frederick's army, involved the
Germans in almost endless troubles by taking them amidst pathless
mountains, where the horrors of starvation and the entire lack of
water added yet more miseries to their condition. Brave where all were
despairing, encouraging his men with cheering words and hopeful looks,
their gallant old leader rode on, and footsore, half-starved, thirsty,
and wretched as they were, the men tried, though tears of agony filled
their eyes, to raise the notes of their Swabian war-song to please
him. Frederick, Duke of Swabia, hastened forward with half the
remaining army, and gaining a victory over a body of Turks, pushed on
till he came to the town of Iconium; when, scattering the enemy before
him, he put the inhabitants to the sword, gained a great booty, and,
more than all, food, drink, and rest for his weary men.</p>

<p>A body of Turks had meanwhile crept round the town, and surrounded the
columns which were advancing under Barbarossa; worn out with sorrow,
hunger, and thirst, even his courage gave way for one moment, as he
thought that this band of Turks had only, in all probability, reached
him by passing over the dead bodies of his brave son and the gallant
Swabians; the aged monarch bowed his head, and the scorching tears of
rage ran down his cheeks; then dashing his hand across his eyes, he
cried: "Christ still lives! Christ conquers!" and shouting to his
followers, they fell on the Turks like lions; Barbarossa with his own
hand sending many a one to his last sleep. Then they marched forward
to Iconium, where rest and plenty awaited them, and where the old
emperor doubtless found much cause for thankfulness when he threw
himself into the arms of his brave son.</p>

<p>At Iconium the army stayed for some time, the soldiers being in sad
need of repose; and then starting afresh, continued as far as the
little river Saleph; when, the road being encumbered with cattle, and
the emperor impatient of delay, he commanded his men to cross the
stream and plunged into the water. Here this hero of many combats,
this brave and wise king, was destined to end his long life in an
obscure river, of which he had probably never heard; the current was
too strong for his horse, and, nobly as the animal battled against it,
both rider and steed were drowned.</p>

<p>The Germans, almost frantic with grief and dismay, made frenzied
efforts to regain the body of their leader; and, when at last they
succeeded, they conveyed it with much loving care to Antioch, where it
was buried in St. Peter's Church.</p>

<p>With the history of the crusade after the death of our hero, we have
nothing to do further than to say that his son, Frederick, took the
chief command and led the brave followers of his gallant father until
a pestilence occasioned his death at Acre, in the following year, when
the remnant of the once formidable army returned to Germany.</p>

<p>The Death of Barbarossa.</p></div>

<p>How Barbarossa still lingers in the hearts of his people even now,
when all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071"></a>(p. 071)</span> these hundreds of years divide his time from
theirs, is shown by a dozen legends. Most of these profess an utter
disbelief in the death of their loved emperor; one of them tells how,
in a rocky cleft of the Klyfhaüser Mountains, Barbarossa still sleeps
calmly and peacefully; he sits before a marble table into which and
through which his red beard has grown; his head is bowed on his folded
hands, and though he from time to time lifts it and opens his eyes, it
is but to shut them again quickly, for the right time of his awakening
is not come; he has seen the ravens flying round the mountain, and his
long sleep will only end when their black forms are no longer visible,
when he will step forth and avenge the wrongs of the oppressed.</p>

<p>Another story says that he is lying in the Untersberg near Salzburg,
and that when the dead pear-tree which, thrice cut down, plants itself
afresh, shall bud forth and blossom, the gallant "Rothbart" will come
out into the bright daylight, hang his shield on the pink-flowered
bough, throw down his gauntlet as a gage to all evil-doers, and, aided
by the good and chivalrous few who will still be inhabitants of this
bad world, will vanquish cruelty and wickedness, and realize the dream
of a golden age they have for so long anticipated.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>RICHARD C&OElig;UR DE LION<br>

(1157-1199)</h3>

<a id="img034" name="img034"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img034.jpg" width="250" height="372" alt="Richard C&oelig;ur De Lion." title="">
</div>

<p>Richard I., King of England, surnamed C&oelig;ur de Lion, was the third
son of Henry II. and his queen, Eleanor, and was born at Oxford, in
the king's manor house there, afterward the monastery of the White
Friars, in September, 1157. By the treaty of Montmirail, concluded on
January 6, 1169, between Henry and Louis VII. of France, it was
stipulated that the duchy of Aquitaine should be made over to Richard,
who should do homage and fealty for it to Louis, and should espouse
Adelais, or Alice, that king's youngest daughter; and in 1170 King
Henry, being taken ill at Domfront, in Maine, made a will, by which he
confirmed this arrangement. In 1173 Richard, with his younger brother,
Geoffrey, and their mother, joined their eldest brother, Henry, in his
first rebellion against their father. On the submission of the rebels,
in September, 1174, Richard received two castles in Poitou, with half
the revenue of that earldom, and, along with Geoffrey, did <span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072"></a>(p. 072)</span>
homage and swore fealty to their father. Nevertheless Richard
continued from this time to hold the government of the whole of
Aquitaine, and to be usually styled, as before, Duke of Aquitaine, or
Duke of Poitou (which were considered as the same title), although it
appears that King Henry now looked upon the arrangements made at the
treaty of Montmirail as annulled, and that dukedom to have actually
reverted to himself. In 1183 Richard refused, when commanded by his
father, to do homage for Aquitaine to his elder brother, Henry; on
which his brothers Henry and Geoffrey invaded the duchy, and a new war
ensued between them and their father, who was assisted by Richard,
which, however, was terminated by the death of the eldest of the three
brothers in June of that same year, when Richard became his father's
heir-apparent. But at an interview between King Henry and Philip
Augustus, now King of France, in November, 1188, Richard, apparently
impelled by a suspicion that his father intended to leave his crown to
his younger brother, John, and also professing to resent his father's
conduct in withholding from him his affianced bride, the French king's
sister, suddenly declared himself the liegeman of Philip for all his
father's dominions in France; whence arose a new war, in which Philip
and Richard speedily compelled King Henry to yield to all their
demands, and a treaty to that effect was about to be signed when King
Henry died, on July 6, 1189. Richard was present at the burial of his
father in the choir of the convent of Fontevrault.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his apprehensions, real or affected, of his brother
John, Richard made no particular haste to come over to England, but,
contenting himself with ordering his mother, Queen Eleanor, to be
liberated from confinement, and to be invested with the regency of
that kingdom, he first proceeded to Rouen, where he was formally
acknowledged as Duke of Normandy on July 20th, and it was August 13th
before he arrived at Portsmouth (or, as others say, at Southampton).
His coronation, from which the commencement of his reign is dated,
took place in Westminster Abbey on September 3d. It was on occasion of
that ceremony that a furious riot broke out among the Jews in London,
which was in the course of the next six months renewed in most of the
great towns throughout the kingdom. At York, in March, 1190, a body of
500 Jews, with their wives and children, having taken refuge in the
castle, found no other way of saving themselves from their assailants
than by first cutting the throats of the women and children and then
stabbing one another.</p>

<p>A short time before his father's death Richard, and his then friend,
Philip Augustus, had, as it was expressed, taken the cross, that is to
say, had publicly vowed to proceed to the Holy Land, to assist in
recovering from the infidels the city and kingdom of Jerusalem, which
had recently (1187) fallen into the hands of the great Saladin. The
mighty expedition, in which all the principal nations of Western
Christendom now joined, for the accomplishment of this object is known
by the name of the Third Crusade. Leaving the government of his
kingdom during his absence in the hands of William Longchamp, Bishop
of Ely and chancellor, and Hugh Pudsey, Bishop of Durham and
justiciary, Richard took his departure from England on December 11th
of this same year, 1189, and proceeding <span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span> to Normandy, united
his forces with those of Philip Augustus in the plain of Vezelay on
July 1, 1190. The two friends proceeded together at the head of an
army of more than 100,000 men as far as Lyons, where they separated on
the 31st; Philip taking the road to Genoa, Richard that to Marseilles,
where he was to meet his fleet. The fleet, however, not arriving so
soon as was expected, Richard in his impatience hired thirty small
vessels for the conveyance of himself and his suite, and, sailing for
Naples, arrived there on August 28th. On September 8th he proceeded by
sea to Salerno, where he remained till the 23d, and then sailed for
Messina, which port his fleet had reached about a week before, with
the army, which it had taken on board at Marseilles. The French king
had also arrived at Messina a few days before his brother of England.</p>

<p>The two kings remained together at Messina till the end of March,
1191. During their stay Richard compelled Tancred, who had usurped the
crown of Sicily, to relinquish the dower of his sister Joan, the widow
of William, the late sovereign, and to pay him besides forty thousand
ounces of gold. In return he betrothed his nephew, Arthur, the son of
his next brother, Geoffrey, to Tancred's infant daughter, and formed a
league offensive and defensive with the Sicilian king&mdash;a connection
which afterward cost him dear, for it was the source of the enmity of
the Emperor Henry VI., who had married Constantia, the aunt of
William, and claimed the throne of Sicily in right of his wife. After
the dispute with Tancred had been settled, the latent rivalry of
Richard and Philip broke out in a quarrel about the Princess Adelais,
whom her brother Philip insisted that Richard should espouse, in
conformity with their betrothment, now that his father no longer lived
to oppose their union. But if Richard had ever cared anything for the
French princess, that attachment had now been obliterated by another,
which he had some years before formed for Berengaria, the beautiful
daughter of Sancho VI. (styled the Wise), King of Navarre; in fact he
had by this time sent his mother Eleanor to her father's court to
solicit that lady in marriage, and, his proposals having been
accepted, the two were now actually on their way to join him. In these
circumstances Philip found himself obliged to recede from his demand;
and the matter was arranged by an agreement that Richard should pay a
sum of ten thousand marks, in five yearly instalments, and restore
Adelais, who had previously been conducted into England, and the
places of strength that had been given along with her as her marriage
portion, when he should have returned from Palestine.</p>

<p>Richard, having sent his mother home to England, sailed from Messina
on April 7th, at the head of a fleet of about two hundred ships, of
which fifty-three were large vessels of the sort styled galleys; his
sister, the queen dowager of Sicily, and the Princess Berengaria
accompanying him. The King of France had set sail about a week before.
Several months, however, elapsed before Richard reached the Holy Land,
having been detained by an attack which he made upon the island of
Cyprus; Isaac, the king, or emperor, of which had ill used the crews
of some of the English ships that had been driven upon his coasts in a
storm. Richard took Limasol, the capital, by assault; and that blow
was soon followed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074"></a>(p. 074)</span> by the complete submission of Isaac and
the surrender of the whole island. Isaac was put into confinement, and
remained a captive till his death in 1195. Meanwhile the island of
Cyprus was made over by Richard, in 1192, to Guy of Lusignan, upon his
resignation of the now merely titular royalty of Jerusalem to his
rival Henry of Champagne and Guy's posterity reigned in that island
till the year 1458.</p>

<p>Having married Berengaria at Limasol, Richard set sail from Cyprus, on
June 4th (1191), with a fleet now described as consisting of thirteen
large ships called busses, fifty galleys, and a hundred transports;
and on the 10th he reached the camp of the crusaders assembled before
the fortress of Acre, the siege of which had already occupied them not
much less than two years, and had cost the lives, it is said of nearly
two hundred thousand of the assailants. But the presence of the
English king, although he was suffering from severe illness, and had
to be carried to the trenches on a litter, immediately inspired so
much new vigor into the operations of the Christian army that, on July
12th, the place surrendered, and Saladin, who had been harassing the
besiegers from the neighboring mountains, withdrew, in conformity with
the terms of capitulation. This great event, however, was immediately
followed by an open rupture between Richard and King Philip, whose
rivalry had already exhibited itself in a variety of ways, and more
particularly in the support given by Richard to the claim of Guy of
Lusignan, and by Philip to that of Conrad of Montferrat to the vacant
crown of Jerusalem. Philip, in fact, took his departure from Palestine
on the last day of July, leaving only ten thousand men, under the
command of the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<a id="img035" name="img035"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img035.jpg" width="400" height="492" alt="" title="">
<p>Richard at the Battle of Arsur.</p></div>

<p>Richard performed prodigies of valor in the Holy Land, but, although a
signal defeat of Saladin on September 7th at Arsur was followed by the
capture of Jaffa and some other places of less importance, Jerusalem,
which was the main object of the crusade, so far from being taken was
not even attacked. Jaffa, however, after it had again fallen into the
hands of Saladin, was recovered by the impetuous valor of the English
king. At last, on October 9, 1192, Richard set sail from Acre in a
single vessel, his fleet, having on board his wife, his sister, and
the daughter of the captive King of Cyprus, having put to sea a few
days before. The three ladies got safe to Sicily; but the first land
the king made was the island of Corfu, which he took about a month to
reach. He left Corfu about the middle of November with three
coasting-vessels which he hired there; but after being a few days at
sea he was compelled by a storm to land on the coast of Istria, at a
spot between the towns of Aquileia and Venice. After narrowly escaping
first from falling at Goritz into the hands of Maynard, a nephew of
Conrad of Montferrat (to whose murder in Palestine Richard, upon very
insufficient evidence, was suspected to be an accessory), and then at
Friesach from Maynard's brother, Frederick of Batesow, he was taken on
December 21st, at Erperg, near Vienna, by Leopold, Duke of Austria (a
brother-in-law of Isaac of Cyprus), and was by him consigned to close
confinement in the castle of Tyernsteign, under the care of his
vassal, Baron Haldmar. In the course of a few <span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075"></a>(p. 075)</span> days,
however, by an arrangement between Leopold and the Emperor Henry VI.,
the captive king was transferred to the custody of the latter, who
shut him up in a castle in the Tyrol, where he was bound with chains,
and guarded by a band of men who surrounded him day and night with
drawn swords. In this state he remained about three months. Meanwhile,
intelligence of his having fallen into the hands of the emperor had
reached England, and excited the strongest sensation among all ranks
of the people. It is sufficient to mention that during his absence a
struggle for supremacy had for some time been carried on with varying
success between the king's brother, John, and Longchamp, the
chancellor, who had acquired the entire regency, and had also been
appointed papal legate for England and Scotland; and that this had
resulted, in October, 1191, in the deposition of Longchamp, by a
council of the nobility held in St Paul's Churchyard, London; after
which he left the country, and although he soon ventured to return,
ultimately deemed it most prudent to retire to Normandy. The supreme
authority was thus left for a time in the hands of John, who, as soon
as he learned the news of his brother's captivity, openly repaired to
Paris, and did homage to the French king for the English dominions on
the Continent.</p>

<a id="img036" name="img036"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/img036.jpg" width="250" height="315" alt="Richard C&oelig;ur De Lion" title="">
</div>

<p>On returning to England, John raised an army to support his
pretensions, while his confederate, Philip, took up arms in his behalf
in France, and, entering Normandy, overran a great part of that duchy,
although Rouen, the capital, was preserved principally by the
exertions of the Earl of Essex, lately one of Richard's companions in
the Holy Land. In England, also, John met with a general opposition to
his usurpation of the regal authority, which soon compelled him to
conclude an armistice with a council of regency that had been
appointed by the prelates and barons. This was the position of affairs
when Longchamp, having discovered Richard's place of confinement,
after much solicitation prevailed upon the emperor to allow the royal
prisoner to be brought before the diet at Hagenau, where, accordingly,
he made his appearance on April 13, 1193, and defended himself with so
much eloquence against the several charges made against him in regard
to Tancred and the kingdom of Sicily, to his conquest of Cyprus, and
to the murder of Conrad of Montferrat, that Henry found himself
compelled by the general sentiment of the diet to order his chains to
be immediately struck off, and to agree to enter upon negotiations for
his ransom. Longchamp was immediately despatched to England with a
letter to the council of regency, and the result was, that,
notwithstanding the insidious efforts both of John and his friend,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076"></a>(p. 076)</span> Philip of France, to prevent the conclusion of the treaty,
Richard was at last liberated, on February 4, 1194, after seventy
thousand marks had been actually paid to the emperor, and hostages
given for the payment of thirty thousand more. The English king had
also engaged to release both Isaac of Cyprus and his daughter, and he
had besides, at the persuasion, it is said, of his mother, Eleanor,
the more effectually to conciliate Henry, formally resigned his crown
into the hand of the emperor, who immediately restored it to him to be
held as a fief of the empire, and burdened with a yearly feudal
payment to his superior lord of five thousand pounds. This strange
transaction rests on the authority of the contemporary annalist
Hoveden. Richard, descending the Rhine as far as Cologne, proceeded
thence across the country to Antwerp, and, embarking there on board
his own fleet, landed at Sandwich on March 13th.</p>

<p>Most of John's strongholds had been wrested from his hands before his
brother's return, and now the rest immediately surrendered and he
himself fled the country, and with his principal adviser, Hugh, Bishop
of Coventry, having been charged with high treason, and not appearing
to plead after forty days, was outlawed and divested of all his
possessions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was thought necessary that Richard should be crowned
again, and that ceremony was accordingly performed at Winchester by
Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, on April 17th. Then, leaving Hubert
guardian of England and grand justiciary, on May 2d, following,
having, with his characteristic activity employed almost every moment
since his arrival in raising an army and procuring funds for its
maintenance by all sorts of exactions and the most unscrupulous use of
every means in his power, he again set sail from Portsmouth, his whole
soul bent on chastising the King of France. Owing to adverse winds he
was a fortnight in reaching Barfleur, in Normandy, where, as soon as
he landed, he was met by his brother John, who professed contrition
and implored his pardon, which, on the intercession of his mother,
Eleanor, was granted. Richard now marched against Philip, and several
engagements took place between them, in most of which the English king
was successful. But the war, though it lasted for some years, was
distinguished by few remarkable events. A truce for one year was
agreed to on July 23d, and although hostilities were resumed some time
before the expiration of that term, a peace was again concluded in the
end of the following year, which lasted till the beginning of 1197.</p>

<p>All this time Hubert, assisted by Longchamp, who had been restored to
his office of chancellor, is said to have presided over the government
at home with great ability. Hubert had been educated under the famous
Glanvil, and he seems, in the spirit of his master, to have exerted
himself in re-establishing and maintaining the authority of the law,
by which alone, even if he did no more, he must have materially
contributed to the revival of industry. The large sums, however, which
he was obliged to raise by taxation to meet the expenses of the war,
in the exhausted state to which the country had been reduced provoked
much popular dissatisfaction; and the third year of the king's absence
in particular was distinguished by the remarkable commotion excited by
William Fitz-Osbert, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span> styled Longbeard, a citizen of London,
who is admitted to have possessed both eloquence and learning, and
whose whole character and proceedings might not improbably, if he had
had his own historian, have assumed a very different complexion from
what has been given to him. Longbeard, who acquired the names of the
Advocate and King of the Poor, is affirmed to have had above fifty
thousand of the lower orders associated with him by oaths which bound
them to follow whithersoever he led. When an attempt was made to
apprehend him by two of the wealthier citizens, he drew his knife and
stabbed one of them, named Geoffrey, to the heart, and then took
refuge in the church of St Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside, the tower of
which he and his followers fortified, and held for three days, when
they were at last (April 7, 1196), dislodged by fire being set to the
building. Fitz-Osbert was first dragged at a horse's tail to the
Tower, and then to the Elms in West Smithfield, where he was hanged,
with nine of his followers. The people, however, long continued to
regard him as a martyr.</p>

<p>The war between Richard and Philip broke out again in 1197, and in the
course of this campaign Richard had the gratification of capturing the
Bishop of Beauvais, a personage whom he had reason to regard as a main
instigator of the severities and indignities which he had sustained at
the hands of the emperor. The bishop was taken armed cap-à-pie and
fighting, and when Pope Celestine recommended him to the clemency of
Richard as his son, the English king sent his holiness the bishop's
coat of mail, with the following verse of Scripture attached to it:
"This have we found; know now whether it be thy son's coat, or no."
This same year, too, finished the career of the Emperor Henry, who, in
his last moments, is said to have expressed the extremest remorse for
the manner in which he had treated the great champion of the Cross.
Richard's other enemy, Leopold, Duke of Austria, had been killed by a
fall from his horse two years before.</p>

<p>A truce, as usual, at the end of the year, again suspended hostilities
for a space. The war was renewed on its termination, and in this
campaign (of the year 1198) Richard gained one of his greatest
victories near Gisors, when Philip in his flight fell into the river
Epte, and was nearly drowned. After this, by the intercession of the
Pope's legate, a truce was concluded between the two kings for five
years, and they never met again in fight; although they probably
would, notwithstanding the truce, if both had lived. But on March 26th
in the following year, 1199, as Richard was engaged in reducing the
castle of Chaluz, the stronghold of one of his Aquitanian vassals,
Vidomar, Viscount of Limoges, who it seems had refused to surrender a
treasure found on his estate, to which the king laid claim in right of
his feudal superiority, C&oelig;ur de Lion was struck in the left
shoulder by an arrow, aimed from the rampart of the castle by a youth
named Bertrand de Gurdun. The wound would not have been dangerous but
for the mismanagement of the surgeon in his attempts to extract the
arrow-head, which had broken off in the flesh. As it was, Richard
lived only till Tuesday, April 16th. The shot was a fatal one in every
way; in the fury into which the wound of the king threw the besieging
army the castle was taken by storm, and all the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span> persons
found in it were immediately hanged, as some authorities say, by the
king's orders, with the exception only of Gurdun. He was brought into
the presence of his dying victim, when Richard, under the impulse of
generosity or compunction, gave him his liberty, with a hundred
shillings to take him home; but after the king's death he was flayed
alive, and then hanged, by order of Marchadee, the leader of the
Brabantine mercenaries serving in Richard's army.</p>

<p>The character of Richard is, of course, not to be judged without
reference to the general manners of the age in which he lived. It is
probable enough that there was hardly an excess, either of violence or
licentiousness, into which his impetuous temperament did not
occasionally precipitate him; but he seems to have had nothing base or
malignant in his composition; and that he was as capable of acts of
extraordinary generosity and disinterestedness as of excesses of
brutal fury or profligacy. Of the courage and strength of will proper
to his race, he had his full share, with more than his share of their
strength of thew and sinew; and his intellectual powers, both natural
and acquired, were also of a high order. He was renowned in his own
day not only as beyond all dispute the stoutest and most gallant of
living heroes, but as likewise occupying a place in the foremost rank
of those who excelled in wit, in eloquence, and in song.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>One reason why those beings who are known to us as saints are so
little understood is, that their lives are usually written in one of
two ways, both equally unsuited to popular appreciation. Either they
are presented in a dry, bare, matter-of-fact manner, which requires
all the knowledge and sympathy of the initiated to give it vital
meaning; or else they are surrounded with an appanage of portents,
visions, miracles, legends&mdash;spread before the reader without
discrimination or explanation&mdash;which confuse the mind and soul, and
absolutely repel all who do not share the faith of the subject and the
biographer.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, no Catholic is obliged to accept these legends
and traditions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079"></a>(p. 079)</span> literally, except in those cases where the
authorities of the Church, after a scrutiny, which is always
deliberate and searching, declare that a miracle was wrought. But
every Catholic, by the very nature of his belief in the actual
presence of the Divinity among men, must acknowledge and maintain that
miracles have been wrought by that supernatural power constantly, ever
since apostolic times; that they may and do occur, through the same
power, at any moment to-day; and always will occur. In the ordinary
gossip of the world, men hold to the maxim that if reports are
current, all pointing to one particular fact, there must be truth in
them. "Where there is so much smoke there is sure to be some fire." We
should at least accord the same, if not a greater, degree of
probability and of credence to stories of the saints which have been
carefully, competently examined. "The love of the marvellous," says
Chavin de Malin, in his book on St. Francis, "is but a remnant of our
original greatness. Man was created to contemplate the wonders of the
Divinity; and, until he clearly beholds them, he is borne onward by an
interior desire to love and admire everything which bears the
slightest resemblance to them.... <i>A person utterly ignorant of the
practices of a spiritual life can no more do justice to the life of a
saint, than a blind man could adjudicate on the merits or demerits of
a painting.</i>" He adds that, with regard to the religious occupations
of the Middle Ages, "the positive bounds of history could not be kept,
digressions were made on all sides, and thus around the true history
of saints, like a poetic wreath, wonder and amazement were both
entwined. Christianity has had its denominated legendary tales, which
invariably are based on truth, and should not be rejected by the
historian without serious reflection and profound study."</p>

<p>There is still another way of regarding the saints; the purely
material view, which denies the immediate action of supernatural power
upon the details of natural daily life, mental or physical. This
view&mdash;or rather, this abstention from seeing&mdash;is futile; because,
without a particle of actual proof to sustain its negative, it refuses
to admit possibilities of truth to which the really comprehensive and
perceptive mind must always hold itself open.</p>

<p>Saint Francis was born at Assisi, in Umbria, in 1182; near the close
of the twelfth century, which has been called a "century of mud and
blood, when darkness prevailed over light, evil over good, the flesh
over the spirit." Umbria was then, as it is now, a beautiful and
fertile valley, rich in citron, almond, aloe, with forest trees of oak
and pine and fir, to which long cultivation has added grapevines,
engarlanding the elms, and orchards of the pale-leaved olive-tree,
that give the landscape a somewhat transparent, aërial effect. The
province is encircled on one hand by the yellow Tiber; on the other,
by the bluish foot-hills of the Apennines; and it is full of ancient
little towns, nestled in the vales, or perched upon the airy
hill-crests, with crenelated towers and terraces which command
far-reaching and inspiring views. Old Perugia guards the northern
entrance to this exquisite region; and five leagues to the northeast
of that town is the saint's birthplace, Assisi.</p>

<p>His father was Peter Bernard of Moriconi, better known as
"Bernardone," a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080"></a>(p. 080)</span> rich merchant who carried on extensive
business with France. In those days Italian merchants maintained a
lavish mode of life, resembling that of the nobles; and as the
disorders of the period and the perils attending travel compelled them
to send armed escorts with their convoys of merchandise, there was
something of military daring and display mingled with their business
and their surroundings. The wife of Bernardone, however, whose name
was Pica (of the noble Bourlemont family of Provence), was remarkable
for her piety; the son&mdash;in this, as in so many historic instances of
genius or distinction&mdash;inheriting his rare quality from the mother's
side. She had but one other child, a younger son, Angelo, who,
notwithstanding his heavenly name, seems to have been a boy after
Bernardone's own pattern; since he, later on, reviled Francis and
called him a fool for his piety and self-renunciation. Angelo's
descendants were still living in Assisi in the latter half of the
sixteenth century. Whether they shared their ancestor's contemptuous
opinion of the Saint has not been recorded; but it seems probable that
the homage of the world, rendered to the poor ascetic for several
centuries, may have made some impression on their minds, if not their
souls.</p>

<p>Just before the birth of Francis, his mother suffered greatly. A
pilgrim, coming to the house for alms, told the servants: "The mother
will be delivered only in a stable, and the child see the light upon
straw." This appeared strange and unreasonable enough. Nevertheless
his advice was followed. Pica was carried to the stable, and there she
gave birth to her first son, whom she caused to be baptized John,
after the beloved apostle of Jesus. Her husband, Bernardone, was
absent at the time on a business tour in France. Upon his return, he
was delighted at finding that he had a boy; and he insisted on giving
him the surname Francis, in commemoration of that country with which
he drove such a flourishing trade. Possibly he was also moved by the
thought&mdash;albeit the chroniclers do not say so&mdash;that his wife's family
came from Southern France. At all events, Francis was the name by
which the son came to be known throughout his life and in history.</p>

<p>Under priestly teachers he received an education which, for that time,
was a fairly good one, in Latin, French, and literature. At the age of
fourteen his father took him into partnership; and for ten years the
young man bought and sold with him, or travelled for him. But while
Bernardone was a hard, avaricious man, the son differed from him
greatly in disposition; being fond of dress, of song, and feasting,
gayety, and gaming. He was generous even to prodigality, full of wit
and imagination, very sympathetic withal, and compassionate. Thomas of
Celano thus describes him: "His figure was above the middle height and
well set. He was thin, and of a very delicate constitution. He had an
oval face, broad brow, white, close-set teeth, dark complexion, black
hair, regular features, expressive countenance, rosy lips, and a
charming smile." With all his roystering, dissipation, and
extravagance, however, he was a foe to immorality, always rebuked
impurity in severe terms, and kept his own purity intact. This lavish
and somewhat reckless pursuit of other pleasures gave his parents much
anxiety; although his mother, Pica, said in his defence, "I see in
him, even in his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081"></a>(p. 081)</span> amusements, a nobility of character which
gives me the highest hopes of his future." But up to his twenty-fourth
year nothing seemed more unlikely than that he should have any
vocation to a holy life. He was called the "flower of the youth" of
Assisi, rejoiced in his gay leadership of the rich young men of the
place, and dreamed of winning military glory.</p>

<p>In this capacity of taking the lead, and in the confident belief he
often expressed that he would one day receive honor from the world, we
see one natural germ of his later spiritual eminence. Another and more
potent germ was the love of the poor, and his pity for them, which he
manifested from childhood. In 1201, taking part as a soldier in a
brief war between Assisi and Perugia, he was captured, with several of
his companions, and imprisoned for a year. This experience, his first
touch of adversity, sobered him a little; opening his eyes to the
contrast between prosperity, with idle amusement and flattery, on the
one hand, and on the other, suffering. Soon after his return home,
also, he was stricken down by a long and painful illness. When he rose
from it and, as a convalescent, took his first walk into the country,
he was astonished to find that the beautiful Umbrian landscape which
he had always so enjoyed, seemed to him cold, discolored, and sombre.
A natural effect of illness, one may say. Yet it more often happens
that when a convalescent returns to fresh air and the beauty of the
earth, his pleasure in them is heightened. At all events Francis was
vividly impressed with the nothingness of nature, as compared with the
eternal splendor of God. But presently the passion for warlike renown
took possession of him again. In 1206 he volunteered to join the Count
of Brienne, a Guelph champion of Italian national independence, who
was defending the Two Sicilies against the attacks of the German
emperor, Frederick II. Announcing to his friends that he was about to
become a great captain, Francis set out for the field of war, richly
apparelled and with a brilliant retinue.</p>

<p>In truth he was shortly to become a great captain, though not as he
expected, in war, but in peace. On the way to Spoleto, southward, a
voice that seemed to come from heaven sounded in his ears; just as
Saul was appealed to while on his way to Damascus and was converted by
it into <i>St. Paul</i>. To the young Umbrian, half asleep, the voice said:
"Francis, which can do thee most good; the master or the servant, the
rich one or the pauper?" He replied: "The master and the rich one."
And the voice resumed: "Why, then, leavest thou God, who is both rich
and the Master, to run after man, who is only the servant and the
pauper?" Then Francis cried: "Ah, Lord; what willest Thou I should
do?" "Go," said the voice, "return to thy native city, for the vision
thou hast had has a spiritual meaning. It is from God, not men, thou
shalt receive its accomplishment."</p>

<p>Heedless of whatever taunts might be flung at him, he turned back. But
the youth of Assisi, though surprised, were rejoiced to see him, and
begged him to preside once more at their revels. He gave them a final
magnificent banquet, at which they noticed that he was silent and
preoccupied. Immediately afterward he retired to a grotto, where he
passed his days alone, entreating God to pardon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span> the misspent
years of youth and to direct him in the right way. Here he had a
vision of Jesus Christ nailed to the cross. It is probably impossible
to prove a vision; but that this one was real to Francis, at least, we
may judge by its effects. Thenceforth he devoted himself to a pious
life of marvellous self-abnegation. Seeing the change that had come
upon him, his former friends fell away; but he, undisturbed, went on
performing works of charity; making gifts of money, food, and even his
own clothes to the poor. Again a voice spoke to him, from the crucifix
of the dilapidated old church of St. Damien: "Francis, go and repair
my house, which you see falling into ruins!" The young ascetic obeyed
literally, and, passing through the streets, begged from all whom he
met a stone or two to help rebuild the old church. Bernardone had been
absent several months on one of his business trips; but his
home-coming, this time, was not so pleasing to him as when his boy had
been born. For, seeing the young man's complete transformation, all
his selfish love of him turned into rage. He imprisoned him for a
while in his own house; but Pica, recognizing that it was useless to
oppose her son's religious vocation, finally set him free, and Francis
took refuge in St. Damien's church. His father pursued him there, and
brought before the Bishop of Assisi a complaint against him, demanding
that he should give up all the money in his hands. Francis not only
surrendered his money, but stripped off his clothing and gave it to
his father, saying: "Until now I have called Peter Bernardone my
father. Henceforth I can boldly say, 'Our Father, who art in heaven,'
in whom I have placed all my treasures and my hopes."</p>

<p>The bishop covered him with his mantle and held him clasped in his
arms, until the by-standers brought Francis the cloak of a poor
peasant. "Oh, what a grand bankrupt this merchant becomes to-day!"
Bossuet wrote of him, long afterward. "Oh man worthy of being written
in the book of the evangelical poor, and henceforward living on the
capital of Providence!" From that time Francis wore mendicant's garb
and begged his food in the streets.</p>

<p>What did he accomplish by all this? To begin with, he succeeded in
rebuilding three churches. But his influence was destined to be much
more far-reaching than that, and of a very different nature. One day,
while he was supplicating in church, his brother Angelo passed near
him, and said to a friend, scoffingly: "Go, ask him to sell you some
drops of his sweat." "No," said Francis; "I shall not sell my sweat to
men. I shall sell it at a higher price, to God." He gave his sweat,
his toil, his sufferings, and his renunciation to God, in exchange for
the regeneration of men in a corrupt age.</p>

<p>All Europe, at that time the whole civilized world, was suffering. The
mass of the people were the poor, who were in deep distress, ground
down by the pride and oppressions of the barons and the rich. The
country was devastated by wars, large and small. The emperors of
Germany were trying to establish their dominion over Italy and to
control the Pope. The Church itself, after emerging from an heroic
struggle with centuries of barbarism, had been obliged to accept and
use the feudal system as a means of self-defence; and now the wrongs,
the injustices, the selfishness of feudal society were beginning to
exercise <span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> a corrupting influence on the exterior of the
Church itself. Unselfish and holy men in ecclesiastical places, both
high and humble, preserved the spirit and sanctity of Christian faith,
but were not able wholly to counteract the evils of pride, wealth, and
luxury that invaded the Church from the worldly side, and infected its
unworthy servants. Francis perceived that the only hope or relief
possible to that age lay in a decisive spiritual revolution, to be
effected without violence, which would recall people to the primitive
simplicity, unselfishness, and absolute devotion of the time of Christ
and the apostolic period. This revolution could be accomplished, he
saw, only by a personal example so strong, so undeviating, so entirely
free from self-seeking, that all men would be compelled to pause and
consider it, and then to act upon it. He therefore sacrificed his
whole life for the good of the race. In the end he achieved his aim,
single-handed, single-souled. No one who believes in God and in
Christianity throughout, can maintain that Francis of Assisi brought
about these results by mere unaided human power. The human element
relies upon will, coercion, man&oelig;uvre, and even intrigue. Francis
gave up all these means. He first served the lepers for a month,
living with them and taking care of them. This should especially
interest us to-day; since Father Damien's self-immolating life among
the lepers of the Hawaiian Islands in recent years is so well known to
us, and since the first refuge of Saint Francis from the world was St.
Damien's church, in Assisi. Portiuncula, "The Little Portion," was one
of the churches which he had rebuilt, and was his favorite. While he
was listening to the Gospel there, one day in February, 1209, these
words were read from the altar: "Do not possess gold nor silver, nor
money in your purses; nor scrip for your journey, nor two coats, nor
shoes, nor a staff."</p>

<p>That precept decided him. He saw his vocation as a devotee of holy
poverty. Straightway he began preaching everywhere the duty of poverty
and love of the poor; and gradually he drew to himself disciples,
until they numbered twelve; sometimes accosting his old friends,
sometimes strangers, who immediately joined him and consented to give
up all worldly things, for the love of God. Most of them were men of
rank and wealth, who had never known privation; yet they gave up
social positions where they had been accustomed to command, accepted
dire penury with him in a hut at Rivotorto, and submitted themselves
to him in entire obedience. "Bread begged from door to door is the
bread of angels," said Francis. They went barefoot, wore a coarse gray
tunic with a cincture of cord, prayed much, helped the sick and needy,
discoursed to and exhorted the people, and lived on bread and water
chiefly. Amid all these austerities they thanked God that they had
been chosen to give an example of perfect happiness! Their leader
insisted upon incessant industry and unfailing cheerfulness. "Think of
your errors in your cells," he commanded. "Weep, kneeling before God.
But before others be gay, and maintain an air of ease." At first they
called themselves simply "penitents from Assisi," and for a time they
were treated with ridicule, scorn, and even violence. But their
mission was to suffer everything, to rejoice at insults and injuries
and, by patience, compel recognition of the dignity <span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span> of every
human creature under whatsoever guise he might present himself. In
this they succeeded.</p>

<p>To a novice he said one day, "Brother, let us go out and preach."
Taking him along, he went up into Assisi and they walked through the
streets without saying a word; then returned to the convent. "And our
preaching, father?" asked the novice. "It is done," replied the Saint;
implying that a modest, thoughtful exterior and the force of example
are often the most eloquent kind of preaching. But in 1209 it became
clear to him by an inward vision in which the Christ came to him as a
shepherd, that great numbers would flock to follow him; and, though he
had not thought of founding an Order, he now saw that it would be
necessary. He therefore drew up a simple Rule in twenty-three
chapters; the gist of which was that they were to possess no money, no
property whatever; that they were neither to blame nor to judge any
one; were to hold themselves profoundly respectful toward all members
of the clergy; to say not a word against the rich or against luxury;
to preach, everywhere, concord and the love of God and one's neighbor;
to bind themselves to obedience and chastity, as well as poverty; to
do penance and persist in the perfect faith of Christ. Not until
sixteen years later did the Lateran Council ordain that all religious
orders must receive the approval of the Holy Father. But Francis did
not wait for decrees. His humility, obedience, and loyalty to the
Vicar of Christ led him to repair to Rome with his companions and
there ask the permission of Pope Innocent III., which he quickly
obtained. The Rule was rewritten in 1619. Some of the brethren
suggested that he take the advice of a cardinal in formulating his
rules; but the Saint declared that God had willed that he should
"appear as a new sort of madman in the world," arresting the attention
of the people and bringing them to reflect, without qualification,
upon "the folly of the cross," and that he alone must direct the
manner in which this was to be done.</p>

<a id="img038" name="img038"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img038.jpg" width="600" height="366" alt="" title="">
<p>The Vision of St Francis.</p></div>

<p>His order multiplied rapidly, and convents were established in all
parts of Europe; although he was inclined to object to costly
buildings, and was prevailed upon to let them stand on the plea that
they were needed to shelter travellers and pilgrims. He established
also the order of Poor Clares, so called from a noble maiden, Clare,
who became its first superior. This was, for women, what his order of
the Friars Minor was for men; though the Clares remained strictly
enclosed, while the Friars went abroad preaching, and established
missions in various quarters of the globe. Finally, he formed his
Third Order, which included laymen and laywomen living in the world,
who bound themselves by simple vows of virtue and charity, while
continuing in their accustomed phase of life. Thousands joined the
Friars; and probably millions were enrolled in the Third Order. It has
been said that Francis first made known to the Middle Ages the power
of association among the weak and humble, and that from the pages on
which he inscribed his institutes sprang modern democracy in Italy.
Certain it is that the Emperor Frederick II. received a letter from
some of his Italian feudal supporters, saying: "The Friars Minor ...
have raised themselves against us. They have publicly condemned both
our mode of life and our principles, they have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> shattered
our rights, and have brought us to nothingness." Yet the Franciscan
Friars and the Third Order had done this only by the contrast of
example, of poverty, fasting, prayer, self-denial, and charity of the
heart as well as of the hands.</p>

<p>The work of Saint Francis did much to undermine feudalism; and it
almost regenerated the spirit of Christianity in the thirteenth
century. "Man of the people," writes R. F. O'Connor, "he did more for
the people than ever yet had been done by any one; whose vocation was
to revive in the midst of a corrupting opulence the esteem and
practice of poverty, which he ennobled, ... and, without setting class
against class, <i>or violating the least point of the divine or human
law</i>, levelled every social barrier and united princes and peasants in
a bond of union which neither time nor eternity was to sever."</p>

<p>This phase of his influence should interest us of to-day, when the
same problems of wealth and poverty and of superficiality in religion
confront our arrogant modern "civilization." That St. Francis was not
a madman is evident from the orderliness of his work, his clear
legislative and administrative capacity, his calm, powerful, amiable
sway over all sorts of people. Yet he was possessed by an absolute
passion and ecstasy of charity and universal love, which raised him
above the apprehension of the gross, material mind. It was this
supremacy of the spiritual in him which enabled him to accomplish
marvels of practical result. Toward the end of his life, this
exaltation of the spirit produced upon his body a singular phenomenon.
His hands and feet appeared to be transpierced by large nails, and a
wound opened in his side, from which blood frequently flowed. In a
word, he bore the wounds, or "stigmata" of Christ, on his own body.
The nails were distinct from the wound, but were apparently blackened
flesh; being inseparable from the hands and feet. This phenomenon was
well attested at the time. Within the present century several similar
cases have occurred, under the observation of modern and approved
sceptical men of science, who find that they occur when there has been
much fasting, loss of sleep, and constant meditation upon the Passion
of Christ. Their testimony states the conditions and verifies the
fact, but does not explain it.</p>

<p>He died at his convent of St. Mary of the Angels (Portiuncula),
October 4, 1226, in perfect lucidity of mind, with patience and simple
resignation, while giving good counsel to his brethren. Of death he
spoke gently as "our sister death;" and when, during his illness, his
physician was obliged to cauterize him with a red-hot iron, he blessed
the iron, speaking of it as "our brother fire," and submitted to the
cauterization, or moxa, without a murmur or sign of pain. One
remarkable thing about him was his extraordinary recognition of all
the powers and elements of nature as related to man in one family
under God. This was the origin of his famous short "sermon to the
birds," which has been preserved. He talked to them and to all other
animals as though he firmly believed that they could understand him,
and could adore their Creator as well as he; though it is not probable
that he supposed they would understand him precisely as men would, or
adore in the same way. It is clear that St. Francis had a great
influence over animals, even over wolves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span> Nowadays we have many lion-tamers and tiger-tamers, who rely
simply upon human will and craft. Therefore it is not astonishing that
St. Francis, who relied upon Divine power, should have been able to
tame beasts. What is surprising is, that he should have been able to
control men, who are so much harder to tame.</p>

<p>The poems of St. Francis&mdash;his "Canticle of the Sun," "Canticle of
Love," and "Canticle of Charity"&mdash;exemplify the immense and tender
scope of his exquisite love and good-will. His Order continues, and
has given rise to subsidiary organizations such as the Recollects and
the Capuchins. Thousands of people in common life belong to his Third
Order, now, and continue his work unostentatiously. His spirit is
alive and operative in the world to-day, nearly six hundred and
seventy years since he left this earth.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>The most striking features of the political history of France during
the tenth and eleventh centuries are the conflict of the feudal
aristocracy on the one hand, with monarchical and democratical power
on the other, and the influence exerted by the Crusades on both.</p>

<p>The Crusades aided much in the accomplishment of the final result, the
destruction of the power of the nobility. In the first place, they
glorified the character of feudalism by enforcing the principles of
chivalry. To be a "true knight," a man must be devout, just, merciful,
and pure. Many Crusaders, indeed, fell far short of this high ideal;
but there can be no doubt that, on the whole, it elevated the standard
of morality, and checked the rampant tyranny which had previously
prevailed. Founded on a principle of sincere though mistaken piety,
the Crusaders recognized all who took the cross as brethren; hence the
meanest serf became, in some measure, free; and the same benign
sentiment extended its effect to all classes. The attraction of a
common cause in foreign lands further contributed to wean the
Crusaders from the class quarrels and domestic feuds which occupied
them at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087"></a>(p. 087)</span> home. During their absence the crown was enabled
to acquire a strength which had previously been spent in the
repression of constant rebellions. And the need of money for the
expedition obliged many feudal lords to contract with the communes for
the sale of lands or liberties.</p>

<p>The Education of Louis IX.</p></div>

<p>Such was the condition of France at the commencement of the thirteenth
century. The balance of power, however, was only sustained by the
activity of all the parties concerned. The slightest wavering on the
part of the crown would be fatal, the least opportunity seized. A
wise, sincere, and humane ruler was needed to confirm and enlarge the
vantage ground which law and order had already obtained; and such a
ruler rose in the person of Louis IX., who ascended the throne in
1226.</p>

<p>His father, Louis VIII., was a man of weak character, whose reign was
chiefly signalized by the horrible persecution of the Protestant
Albigenses of Provence, which, under the sanction of Innocent III.,
and later Popes, had been carried on by Simon de Montfort and other
fanatics, since 1209. Louis himself had died of fever when about to
commence the siege of Toulouse.</p>

<p>The Queen Dowager, Blanche, of Castile, was a woman of great energy,
and during the minority of her son she bravely contested her claims to
the regency of the kingdom against those of Philip, her husband's
brother, whom Henry III., of England, supported. She appealed, not in
vain, to the gratitude of the metropolis, which the Capetian kings had
befriended; and at her call a large force of citizens joined her. With
their aid she defeated Philip and other nobles, who opposed her son's
coronation, and by two treaties, in 1229 and 1231, she both extended
the limits of her kingdom and put an end to civil war. Over Louis, who
was but eleven years old when his father died, she exercised a
somewhat rigorous, but a holy and prudent discipline, to which he was
much indebted for strengthening his moral and mental constitution. He
was educated at the Abbey of Royaumont by Vincent de Beauvais, and
though not remarkable for talents, possessed considerable decision of
character, and a large share of personal courage. It is, however, by
the piety, purity, and benevolence of his soul that he stands forth so
prominently in the history of Europe. The year of his coronation all
the jails of the kingdom were thrown open by the royal command. A
nature more truly loving and lovable has rarely been bestowed on any
member of the human family. Yet, with all these paramount excellences,
his life presents a tragedy&mdash;the fatal consequences of unreasoning
faith. All his errors&mdash;we cannot justly call them faults&mdash;proceeded
from this prolific source. Before recording these, it will be
gratifying to point out the happier results of those noble and wise
qualities which have consecrated his name.</p>

<p>After the treaty of 1231, France remained at peace for some years,
during which time Louis married Margaret of Provence, a princess only
inferior in worth to himself. Soon after attaining his majority he was
called upon to contend with the Count of Brittany and other nobles who
resisted his authority. At the head of his vassals Louis marched
against the rebels, and was so prompt and energetic in his measures
that the count was forced to yield and sue for pardon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span> in the
attitude of a criminal, with a rope round his neck. Henry III. crossed
the channel with an army to support the rebellion, and recover, if
possible, the possessions which King John had surrendered to King
Philip. The armies met at Saintes, in 1242, where the French were
victorious, the rebels subsequently submitting, and Henry returning
home.</p>

<p>In 1244 Louis had a severe illness, which was attended with danger to
his life. During the progress of it, he vowed to undertake a new
crusade should he recover. The fulfilment of this vow was opposed by
Blanche of Castile (who still had great influence over her son) and
many of his best counsellors; but Louis was inflexible where religion
and honor demanded a sacrifice.</p>

<p>In 1248 he collected a large army, and prepared to start by way of
Sicily, the nearest route to Palestine, when he remembered that the
island belonged to Frederick II., of Germany, who was under
excommunication by the Pope. All attempts to shake the decision of
Innocent IV. failed; and yielding to the pious weakness of fearing to
rest in an excommunicant's territory, Louis changed his plans, and
determined to pass by way of Cyprus and Egypt&mdash;a route which proved
the ruin of the expedition. He committed the regency of France to his
mother, assumed the staff of pilgrimage, and accompanied by his wife
and brothers, left Paris on June 12, 1248. He stayed for several
months in Cyprus, until his armament amounted to 50,000 men, and then
sailed for Egypt.</p>

<p>Arrived at the port of Damietta, he caused the oriflamme (the national
standard of France) to be waved above his head; and, arrayed in
complete armor, he unsheathed his sword, and leaped into the sea,
followed by the knights. The inhabitants fled, and the French took
possession of the city. The inundation of the Nile prevented their
further movements for several months. Licentiousness and disease were
fostered by this delay, in spite of the king's remonstrances; and
their unopposed success made the Crusaders careless as to the tactics
of the enemy.</p>

<p>On the subsidence of the Nile, Louis fortified Damietta, and left his
queen and her ladies there, while he, with the main army, advanced on
Cairo, the metropolis of Egypt, where the sultan resided. Near
Mansourah, the Crusaders became perplexed by the intricacy of the
canals, and a hasty dash across one of these, made by the king's
brother, the Count of Artois, with 2,000 men, led to a calamitous
result. Mansourah was apparently deserted, and the count's troops, who
preceded their comrades at some distance, commenced pillaging the
houses. The inhabitants, who were only concealed, showered down stones
from the roofs; and at the same moment, a large body of the sultan's
army made an attack in front. Louis reached Mansourah in time to save
a few of his men, but found his brother and several others slain. The
Moslem camp was captured, but proved a doubtful prize. The plains were
barren and scorching, and the harassing assaults of the Egyptians, who
poured "Greek fire" (missiles filled with combustible materials) on
their foes, rendered the situation more intolerable still. Pestilence
broke out, and the king himself fell dangerously ill. He then ordered
a retreat to Damietta, whither the sick were to be conveyed in
galleys. These were intercepted, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> and the sick murdered by
the Egyptians; while, at the same time an attack was made on the
Christian camp.</p>

<a id="img041" name="img041"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/img041.jpg" width="250" height="329" alt="St. Louis." title="">
</div>

<p>Louis was so weak that he could scarcely ride, but nevertheless would
not desert his post. He rode between the ranks, encouraging his men,
till he fainted and was obliged to withdraw from the field. His quaint
and affectionate biographer, the Lord of Joinville, who was with him
in this expedition, thus describes the scenes which ensued: "Of all
his men-at-arms there was only one with him, the good knight, Sir
Geoffrey de Sargines; and who, I heard say, did defend him like as a
faithful servant doth guard his master's cup from flies&mdash;for every
time that the Saracens did approach the king he defended him with
vigorous strokes of the blade and point of his sword, and his strength
seemed doubled. At last he brought the king to a house where there was
a woman from Paris; and laying him on the ground, placed his head on
the woman's lap, expecting every moment that he would breathe his
last." In this half-dying condition a body of Egyptians found him, and
bore him to the tent of the sultan. The defeat of the Christians, who
were weakened by the climate, disease, and want of food, was general;
many fell by the sword, and the rest were taken prisoners with their
king.</p>

<p>In captivity Louis showed a noble resignation and courage amid the
apostasy of many. He won the respect of the sultan, who treated him
with generosity, and listened to the terms of ransom which he
proposed. The queen remained at Damietta, which was strongly
garrisoned. Fearful, nevertheless, of falling into the hands of the
Moslems, who would have carried her into the sultan's harem, she
prayed an old knight in her suite to slay her with his sword, should
there be any danger of that event. "I had determined on so doing,
madam," was the answer. Margaret's heroism was not put to this severe
test, for the surrender of Damietta was one of the conditions of her
husband's release; and after paying in addition a sum of 400,000
livres, Louis was on the point of being set free. An insurrection,
however, suddenly arose among the Mamelukes, or Tartarian troops, in
whose hands the real power of the state was placed, and the sultan was
murdered. A party of the assassins, it is said, entered the chamber of
Louis with their scimitars drawn, but his calm dignity saved him, and
the treaty was carried out by the new sultan.</p>

<p>Many of the French nobles returned home, but the king, faithful to his
vow, proceeded to Syria, and spent four years in strengthening the
fortresses of Tyre <span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090"></a>(p. 090)</span> and other Christian towns, redeeming many
Crusaders from slavery, and reducing to order the disturbed condition
of the country.</p>

<p>The death of the Queen Dowager Blanche, who had governed France wisely
during her regency, recalled him in 1254, after an absence of six
years. He still wore the cross upon his shoulder, as a token that his
oath as a Crusader was not yet fulfilled; but he never once neglected
the more pressing and necessary duties which devolved on him as a
monarch. His immediate work was to supersede the arbitrary legislation
which the nobles exercised in their manorial courts over their
tenants. He accordingly introduced into general use the famous code of
Roman laws known as the Pandects of Justinian, and constituted the
chief civil lawyers, who had studied its contents and were best
acquainted with its principles, into a Parliament, or Court of
Justice. The nobles and the clergy were duly represented in this
assembly; but its clerks, or lawyers, were especially favored by the
king, who seconded their own efforts to absorb the business of the
court as much as possible. Louis further mediated between the tyranny
of the nobles and the weakness of their tenants, by encouraging the
practice of appealing to the crown in case of injustice. This he even
extended to ecclesiastical matters; a bold step for one so devoted to
the Church. The prohibition of the barbarous custom of duelling to
decide personal quarrels was another of his humane laws. These, and
divers other ordinances, founded in a like spirit of equity, are known
in a collected shape as the <i>Institutes of St. Louis</i>. His enactment
touching appeals from the Church to the Crown, and the prohibition
which he likewise issued against the levying of money in France for
the use of the Pope without the king's license, are known as a
<i>Pragmatic Sanction</i>&mdash;a term applied to any especially important
national decree. Louis set the example of enforcing the laws
personally, and none was fitter to administer them than he. Under an
oak in the forest of Vincennes, near Paris, often sat the good king to
hear appeals and petitions from his poor subjects. His social and
foreign relations were as fully attended to as his political reforms.
He first placed the French navy on a substantial footing. To him Paris
owed a public library, a hospital for the blind, and the establishment
of a body of police. Under his sanction, also, his confessor, Robert
de Sorbon, founded the famous theological college called by his name.
So scrupulously just and honorable was Louis, that he appointed a
commission to ascertain what restitution of territory should be made
to nations which had been mulcted by the conquests of his
predecessors, and he thus more than once sacrificed extensive
possessions for the sake of a principle. By a treaty in 1255, made
with Henry III., Louis restored to the English crown the provinces of
which Philip Augustus had deprived it, and obtained in return the
surrender of Henry's rights in Normandy and other fiefs. The
reputation which Louis thus acquired among his fellow-monarchs led to
his being asked to act as mediator in several quarrels, and gave him
many opportunities of exhibiting his peaceful and loving policy.</p>

<p>Louis IX. opens the Jails of France.</p></div>

<p>The mental blindness of which we have spoken led him to commit errors,
which, if his misled conscience had not sanctioned them, would deserve
the name <span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091"></a>(p. 091)</span> of crimes. Toward Jews and heretics he showed no
mercy, issuing severe and unjust laws against them "for the good of
his soul." The duty of the historian is to record these failings of a
noble nature as impartially as its beauties; but the evil must, in all
fairness, be credited to the Church and system which taught, and not
to the believer who practised.</p>

<p>In 1270 the affairs of the East again attracted the attention of
Europe, and recalled Louis to the fulfilment of his vow, which he had
only postponed. The Greeks had retaken the city of Constantinople from
the French and Venetian Crusaders some years previously, yet the
reconstitution of the Christian Empire of the East had not availed to
check the aggressions of the Moslem in Palestine. Benocdar, the Sultan
of Egypt, had already taken Cæsarea and Jaffa; and news now came that
Antioch had fallen, 100,000 Christians having been massacred in the
siege. The seventh and last Crusade was at once set on foot by
outraged Europe, and Louis led the expedition, in which France was, as
usual, foremost. He raised an army of 6,000 horse and 30,000 foot, and
was accompanied by his three sons, the King of Navarre, and several
nobles of high rank. His brother, Charles of Anjou (the new King of
Naples), and Edward I., of England, (then prince), were to join the
French in the course of the year. Some romantic intelligence that the
Moslem King of Tunis was desirous of being baptized, induced the pious
Louis again to try the African, instead of the Asiatic, route to
Palestine. He narrowly escaped with his life, in a tempest which
overtook the fleet in the Mediterranean, but landed in Sardinia, and
after recruiting here again set sail, and anchored off Carthage. He
met with opposition, instead of welcome, from the inhabitants of the
coast, and was obliged to besiege Tunis. The excessive heat of the
climate and the unhealthiness of the soil proved a second time fatal
to the army. Plague at last broke out, and Louis was himself seized.
Finding himself dying, he sent for Philip, his eldest son and
successor. Placing in his hand a written paper, the good king prayed
his son to follow the directions which it contained&mdash;directions for
the conduct of his life, as king and individual; enforcing those
principles of love to God and man which had guided his own career.
Then, requesting to be lifted from his bed, Louis instructed his
attendants to strew the floor of his tent with ashes and place him
thereon, that he might die as he had lived, in an attitude of
humiliation and penitence toward his creator. This was done, and
shortly afterward, as though in vision fulfilling the vow which he was
not permitted to realize, he uttered, "I will enter thy house&mdash;I will
worship in thy sanctuary!" and expired. His age was but fifty-four.</p>

<p>A few hours elapsed, and the sound of a trumpet echoed through the
plague-stricken and half-deserted camp. It was the note of Charles of
Naples, whose fleet had just arrived off the coast. Meeting with no
response, he rode rapidly toward the tent of the king, and on entering
saw his body lying still warm upon the ashes. The rites of burial were
not performed with the usual formalities, his remains being
distributed among his relatives. The flesh was kept by Charles, who
buried it, on his return to Sicily, in the great Abbey of Monreale, at
Palermo. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092"></a>(p. 092)</span> The bones and other parts were conveyed back to
France. Those who have visited Paris will not forget the exquisite
Gothic structure known as the "Sainte Chapelle," which is attached to
the Palais de Justice, containing the courts of law. It was erected by
Louis as a receptacle for certain supposed relics of Christ. The
windows of the chapel are entirely composed of stained glass, and as
the sunbeams strike upon them, their tints of crimson, blue, and
orange blend into a rainbow-like harmony of glowing and lustrous
color, which recalls the heart of Louis IX., enshrined within those
walls, as its fitting human antitype. He was canonized about thirty
years afterward, under the title of St. Louis.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>MARCO POLO<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7" title="Go to footnote 7"><span class="small">[7]</span></a><br>

</div>

<p>In the month of November, in the year 1295, there appeared in the
beautiful city of Venice three strangers, who were clothed in an
outlandish and shabby garb of a Tartar cut. They claimed to be of
Venice, but, according to one of their biographers, one Ramusio,
"through the many worries and anxieties they had undergone, they were
quite changed in aspect, and had got a certain indescribable smack of
the Tartar both in air and accent, having, indeed, all but forgotten
their Venetian tongue." They went to the house of the Polo family,
demanding entrance and claiming to be Nicolo Polo, Maffeo, his
brother, and Marco, son of the elder of the two brothers, Nicolo. They
were laughed to scorn as pretenders and impostors; for the three
missing members of the Polo family had been gone away from Venice some
twenty-odd years; it was in 1271 that the Polos were last heard from,
then at Acre, journeying into the Far East.</p>

<p>But the three somehow gained access to their own house, then in the
possession of one of their relations. And the news of their
home-coming was presently noised abroad throughout the city of Venice;
so much so that the people for days talked of little else save the
reappearance in the land of the living of the long-lost travellers.
Many, however, doubted if these really were the brothers Polo and
young Marco; this last was a mere lad of seventeen when he went away,
and now was grown to be a portly man of forty-odd years. So
incredulous were the townsfolk that the brothers hit upon a scheme to
convince the doubting ones. They made a grand feast to which all the
gentry were invited, for the Polo family were of noble birth and had
held station in the state. The entertainment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span> was served in
great splendor with gold and silver dishes, and the three travellers,
when they sat down, were dressed in robes of the richest crimson satin
flowing down to the ground. After some of the courses had been eaten,
they retired to their chamber and came forth again dressed in other
robes of crimson silk damask, very rich, and the satin garments were
cut up and divided among the servants. Again, later on in the repast,
they retired, and when they came again to the table they wore other
robes, of the richest crimson velvet, and the second garments were cut
up and divided as the others had been. When the dinner was over they
took off the velvet robes, and these were disposed of in like manner.
"These proceedings," says the honest Ramusio, "caused much wonder and
amazement among the guests," which we can well imagine.</p>

<p>Next, dismissing all the servants, the younger one of the three, Marco
Polo, went to an inner chamber and brought forth to the table the
coarse and shabby dresses in which the three had arrived in Venice.
Then, taking sharp knives, the travellers ripped open the seams and
welts of the garments, and shook from them a vast profusion of
diamonds, rubies, sapphires, carbuncles, emeralds, and other precious
stones. The guests were dumfounded and amazed. "And now," says
Ramusio, "they recognized that in spite of all former doubts, these
were in truth those honored and worthy gentlemen of the Casa Polo that
they claimed to be; and so all paid them the greatest honor and
reverence." Furthermore, we are told that when the story got wind in
Venice, straightway the whole city, gentle and simple, flocked to the
house to embrace the three travellers, and to make much of them with
every conceivable demonstration of affection and respect.</p>

<p>This was the wonderful home-coming of the three Polos, who for
twenty-four years had been wandering in the East, and who, when they
set out on their homeward journey, a journey beset with untold
difficulties and dangers, took the precaution to conceal in their
garments, as above told, the wealth which they had accumulated while
they were at the court of the Great Khan of Tartary. It reads like a
romance, a story out of "The Arabian Nights' Entertainments." But it
is all true, and the archives of Venice corroborate pretty nearly all
the details herein set forth. Indeed, as a prophet is not without
honor save in his own country and among his own kindred, it must be
said that the later generation of Venetians found less difficulty in
believing the tales of the three travellers than did those who first
heard them. In telling these tales, they had frequent occasion to use
the word "millions," a word not then common among the Venetians, as to
say that the Great Khan had revenues amounting to ten or fifteen
<i>millions</i> of gold, and so on. And the people gave Marco, who seems to
have been the story-teller of the party, the nickname of Messer Marco
Millioni. Curiously enough, this name appears in the public records of
old Venice.</p>

<p>Of the final exit of the elders of the Polo family, Nicolo and Maffeo,
we have no trustworthy account. As they were well stricken in years
when they returned from their long sojourn in Cathay, we may suppose
that they did not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span> live long after their return to Venice.
But the younger Marco had a busy and stirring life. At that time the
republics of Venice and Genoa were rivals for the ruling of the seas
and the monopoly of maritime trade everywhere. A Venetian galley could
not meet one from Genoa without a fight, and the fleets of the two
states were continually at war.</p>

<p>Marco, being one of the representatives of the noble Venetian families
who were required to come to the support of the state with at least
one galley, entered the naval service of Venice in command of a war
galley, and was engaged in the great battle between Venice and Genoa
near Curzola, off the Dalmatian coast, in 1298, three years after his
return from Cathay. The Venetians were beaten ignominiously, and 7,000
of them were taken prisoners and carried to Genoa. It was a lucky
thing for the world that Marco Polo was thus put into enforced
idleness, and that he had for a companion in confinement an educated
gentleman, one Rusticiano, of Pisa. Otherwise, most likely we never
would have heard of the travels of Marco Polo, whom some of the later
chroniclers have likened to Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>

<p>To beguile the tedium of their imprisonment, Marco was wont to tell
his traveller's tales to his companion, Rusticiano, and this worthy
gentleman conceived the notion of writing out the marvellous
adventures and observations of his fellow-prisoner. We must bear in
mind that the Italian gentry of that time did not hold in high esteem
the art of writing, and although Marco was not inferior to any man in
daring or adventurousness, he was willing to leave to the scriveners
the task of writing about such matters. But, in the end, the advice of
Rusticiano prevailed, and the Pisan gentleman set down from the
dictation of Marco "The Book of Ser Marco Polo Concerning the Kingdoms
and Marvels of the East." This was, up to that time, the most
important book of travels and voyages ever written. Indeed, it was the
most important book of any kind written during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The book contributed more new facts toward a knowledge of the earth's
surface, says one skilled authority, than any book that had been
written before. The writer was the first to describe China, or Cathay,
in its vastness of territory, its wonderfully rich and populous
cities, and the first to tell of Tartary, Thibet, Burmah, Siam,
Cochin-China, the Indian Archipelago, the Andaman Islands, of Java and
Sumatra, of the fabled island of Cipangu, or Japan, of Hindustan, and
that marvellous region which the world learned to know as Farther
India. From far-voyaging sailors he brought home accounts of Zanzibar
and Madagascar, and the semi-Christian country of Abyssinia, where
some accounts located that mysterious potentate called Prester John.
He had traversed Persia and had picked up a vast amount of information
concerning the country of Siberia, with its polar snows and bears, its
dog-sledges, and its almost everlasting winter. He traversed the
entire length of Asia.</p>

<p>Surely, Europe might well be dazed when this account of regions, until
then unknown, was unrolled before the scholars and explorers who could
read the few precious books then in circulation. For it should be
remembered that the art of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> printing was then unknown, and
only in manuscript did any book make its appearance. Rusticiano wrote
in a very poor sort of French; for then, as now, that language was
commonest in all the cities of Europe. How much of the language of the
book of Marco Polo's travels was Marco's, and how much was the worthy
Rusticiano's, we are unable to decide. The facts in that famous book
were duly vouched for by Marco. The opening chapter, or prologue,
inflated and wordy, after the fashion of the times, was undoubtedly
Rusticiano's. He began thus: "Great Princes, Emperors, and Kings,
Dukes and Marquises, Counts, Knights, and Burgesses! and People of all
degree who desire to get knowledge of the various races of mankind and
of the diversities of the sundry regions of the World, take this Book
and cause it to be read to you. For ye shall find therein all kinds of
wonderful things, and the divers histories of the Great Hermenia, and
of Persia, and of the Land of the Tartars, and of India, and of many
another country of which our Book doth speak, particularly and in
regular succession, according to the description of Messer Marco Polo,
a wise and noble citizen of Venice, as he saw them with his own eyes."</p>

<p>This portentous prologue ends with these great swelling words: "And I
may tell you that in acquiring this knowledge he spent in those
various parts of the World good six-and-twenty years. Now, being
thereafter an inmate of the Prison at Genoa, he caused Messer
Rusticiano, of Pisa, who was in the same Prison likewise, to reduce
the whole to writing; and this befell in the year 1298 from the birth
of Jesus."</p>

<p>One year later, in the summer of 1299, Marco Polo was set at liberty
and returned to Venice, where he died peacefully in 1324. His last
will and testament, dated January 9, 1323, is preserved among the
archives of Venice, and a marble statue in his honor was set up by the
Venetians, in the seventeenth century, and may be seen unto this day
in the Palazzo Morosini-Gattemburg, in the Campo S. Stefano of that
city.</p>

<p>How came Marco Polo to be drawn so far into the vague and shadowy
East? Somewhere about the middle of the thirteenth century, certain
members of the Polo family had established a trading-house in
Constantinople, then pretty near the end of the world from Europe.
These adventurous Venetians, in 1260, sent the two brothers, Nicolo
and Maffeo, still further to the eastward on a trading journey to the
Crimea. Led on by one adventure and another, and lured by the hope of
new and greater gains, they ascended the Volga northward and eastward,
crossed Bokhara, and finally broke into one of the northwestern
provinces of China, or Cathay, then faintly known in Europe by various
names, the most classic of which was Seres.</p>

<p>Here they made their way to the capital city of the Great Mongol
Empire, the seat of government where ruled the Great Khan, a very
mighty potentate, Kublai Khan, grandson of the famous conqueror,
Ghenghis Khan. Kublai Khan resided at the wonderful city of Cambuluc,
which we now know as Pekin. North of the Great Wall, and some one
hundred and eighty miles from Cambuluc, was the Great Khan's summer
palace, one of the wonders of the world, reading of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span> which in
Purchas' account of Marco Polo's travels, it is said that Coleridge
fell asleep and dreamed the famous poem beginning:</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "In Xanadu did Kublai Khan<br>
<span class="add1em">A stately pleasure dome decree,</span><br>
  Where Alph, the sacred river, ran,<br>
  Through caverns measureless to man,<br>
<span class="add1em">Down to a sunless sea."</span></p>

<p>These Polo brothers were the first Europeans that the Great Khan had
ever seen; but before this time, Friar Plano Carpini, in 1246, and
Friar William Rubruquis, in 1253, had penetrated into Mongolia on some
errand not now distinctly understood, but far enough to learn that a
great and civilized country existed somewhere in the eastern extremity
of Asia. They also learned that beyond this extremity of the continent
there was a sea; people had until then believed that the eastern end
of Asia disappeared in a vast and reedy bog, beyond which was deep and
impenetrable darkness. More exact knowledge of that far eastern sea
was subsequently acquired by the Venetian travellers. From these
wandering friars the Great Khan had heard, at second-hand, doubtless,
of European princes, potentates, and powers, and of the Pope of Rome.</p>

<p>He was mightily taken with the noble Venetians, and we are told that
he treated them with every courtesy and consideration. He was anxious
to secure through them the aid of the Sovereign Pontiff, of whose
functions he entertained high respect, in the civilizing of the hordes
that had lately been added to the Mongol Empire by wars of conquest.
And he entreated the good offices of the polished and cultivated
Venetians in securing for him the good offices of the Pope for that
end. Accordingly, the two brothers, after satisfying to some degree
their curiosity, set out for home, full of tales of their strange
adventure, we doubt not; and they reached Venice in 1269, only to find
that the Pope Clement IV. was dead, and that no successor had been
chosen in his place.</p>

<p>There was a long interregnum, and the brothers, taking with them the
son of Nicolo, the young Marco, then a stout lad, began to retrace
their steps to Cathay, despairing of being able to enlist the one
hundred priests which the Great Khan had asked them to borrow for
missionary purposes from the Pope.</p>

<p>At Acre, then held by European powers that had been engaged in the
crusades for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre, they took counsel
with one Tebaldo Visconti, an eminent prelate, who was Archdeacon of
Liége and a person of great consequence in the Eastern church. At
their request, he wrote letters to the Great Khan, authenticating the
causes of their failure to fulfil the wishes of the Khan in the matter
of obtaining the missionaries whom he desired. Then they pushed on
toward the farther East, and while waiting for a vessel to sail from
the port of Ayas, on the Gulf of Scanderoon, then the starting-point
for the Asiatic trade, they were overtaken by the news that their
friend the Archdeacon Tebaldo had been chosen Pope, under the title of
Gregory X. They at once returned to Acre, and were able to present to
the newly elected <span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> pontiff the request of the Great Khan and
get a reply. But instead of one hundred teachers and preachers, they
were furnished with only two Dominican friars; and these lost heart
and drew back before the journey was fairly begun. It may be said here
that the Great Khan, being disappointed by the Roman Church,
subsequently applied to the Grand Llama of Thibet, and from that
source secured the teachers whom he so greatly desired. The Great Khan
appears to have been an enlightened and liberal sovereign, and,
according to his lights, was willing to furnish to his people the best
form of religion that was to be had. He preferred the religion of the
elegant and polished Italians, but, failing to get this, he naturally
turned his eyes in the direction of Thibet, then an unknown land to
all Europeans, but regarded in Mongolia as a region of some
considerable civilization.</p>

<p>The three members of the Polo family finally set out on their return
to Cathay, leaving Acre in November, 1271. They proceeded by the way
of Ayas and Sivas to Mardin, Mosul, and Bagdad to Hormuz, at the mouth
of the Persian Gulf. Here they met with some obstacle and turned from
Hormuz, and traversed successively Kerman and Khorassan, Balkh, and
Badakhshan, by the way of the upper Oxus, to the plateau of Pamir;
thence crossing the steppes of Pamir, the three travellers descended
upon Kashgar, whence they proceeded by Yarkand and Khotan to the
vicinity of Lake Lob; and, crossing the desert of Gobi, they reached
the province of Tangut in the extreme northwestern corner of China, or
Cathay. Skirting the northern frontier, they finally reached the
actual presence of the Great Khan, who was then at his summer palace
of Kaipingfu, before spoken of, situated at the base of the Khingan
Mountains, fifty miles north of the Great Wall. One may form some idea
of the difficulties of Asiatic travel in those days, as well as the
leisurely habits of the time, by considering that this journey
occupied the three Venetians three years and a half. They arrived at
the palace of the Khan about May, 1275.</p>

<p>The Polos were very cordially and gladly received by the potentate,
then ruling over a territory so vast that it has been well said that,
"In Asia and Eastern Europe scarcely a dog might bark without Mongol
leave, from the borders of Poland and the coast of Cilicia to the
Amoor and the Yellow Sea." Kublai Khan regarded the young Marco with
especial favor, and soon began to employ him in errands and
commissions of importance. "The Young Bachelor," as he is called in
his book, took pains to acquire at once an acquaintance with the
Chinese alphabet, and to learn the languages and dialects of the
countries in which he found profitable and interesting employment.</p>

<p>It appears that the Khan had been greatly annoyed by the stupidity of
his own officials and agents. They attended only to the errands on
which they were sent, and brought back absolutely no knowledge of the
distant countries that they visited, except that which they were
specially directed to fetch. Very different was the conduct of the
young Venetian. He was shrewdly observant, of a lively disposition,
and given to inquiring into the strange and wonderful things which he
beheld in those remote parts of the world, hitherto secluded from the
observation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span> of Europeans. He made copious and minute notes
of all that he saw and heard, for the benefit of his imperial master.
These notes afterward served him a good purpose, as we shall see; for
they were the basis of the book that has made the name of Marco Polo
famous throughout the world. When he returned to the imperial court,
we can imagine the satisfaction with which the picturesque and
intelligent narrations of what he had seen and heard were received by
the Great Khan.</p>

<p>In the records of the Mongol dynasty has been found a minute setting
forth the fact that a certain Polo, undoubtedly young Marco, was
nominated a second-class commissioner attached to the privy council of
the Empire, in the year 1277. His first mission appears to have taken
him on public business to the provinces of Shansi, Shensi, Sechuen and
Yunnan, in the southern and southwestern part of China, and east of
Thibet. Even now, those regions are comparatively unknown to the rest
of the world; and one must needs admire the intrepidity of the young
Venetian who penetrated their wild mountain fastnesses, traced their
mighty rivers, and carried away for the delight of the Great Khan,
much novel information concerning the peoples that so numerously
flourished in that cradle of the human race.</p>

<p>In his book Marco Polo does not greatly magnify himself and his
office, and it is only incidentally, as it were, that we know that he
was for three years governor of the great city of Yangchau. Following
the details laid down in his book, the accuracy of which we have no
reason to doubt, we find him visiting the old capital of the Khans, in
Mongolia, employed in Southern Cochin-China, and on a mission to the
Indian Seas, when he visited some of the states of India, of which
Europeans at that time had only dimly heard the most fabulous and
vague accounts. That the Polos were all favorites of the Great Khan is
sufficiently evident; but it does not appear that any but Marco was in
the employment of the Khan. All three of them doubtless made hay while
the sun shone, and gathered wealth as they could, trading with the
people and making use of their Venetian shrewdness in dealing with the
natives, who were no match for the cunning traders from the Rialto.</p>

<p>Naturally, they longed to carry their wealth and their aged heads&mdash;for
the two elders were now well stricken in years&mdash;safely back to their
beloved Venice on the Adriatic, so far away. But Kublai Khan would not
listen to any of their suggestions, and turned a deaf ear to their
hints. A happy chance intervened to bring them out of the wild,
mysterious realm of the Great Khan. Arghun, Khan of Persia, a
great-nephew of Kublai, had lost by death his favorite wife, who was
of one of the Mongol tribes, and who, dying in 1286, laid a parting
injunction on the Khan that he should wed none but a Mongol princess.
Sorely mourning her, the Persian Khan sent an embassy to the court of
Kublai Khan to solicit a suitable bride for him. The Lady Kuchachin, a
damsel of seventeen, beautiful and virtuous, was selected by the Court
and was made ready to be sent to Tabriz, then the capital of the
Persian Empire. The overland journey was highly dangerous, as it lay
through regions tenanted by hostile and warlike tribes, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099"></a>(p. 099)</span>
besides being portentously long to be undertaken by a delicate young
princess. The Persian envoys, accordingly, entreated the Great Khan to
send with them by sea the three foreigners, of whose seamanship they
undoubtedly held high opinion, especially as the young Marco had just
returned from his distant and venturous voyage to the Indian Seas.
With much reluctance the Khan consented, and the argosy set forth.</p>

<p>Having given leave for the three Venetians to sail, the Great Khan
fitted them out nobly and endowed them with handsome presents at
parting. They sailed, so far as we can now make out, from the port of
Zayton, better known as Chinchau, in Fokien, at the beginning of the
year 1292, two hundred years before Columbus set forth upon his voyage
across the Ocean Sea.</p>

<p>It was an ill-starred and unfortunate voyage for the three Polos and
their precious charge, although all escaped with their lives and
treasure. They were detained five months on the coast of Sumatra, and
there were even longer detentions off the southern coast of India, so
that more than two years had passed since their departure from Fokien,
when they arrived at the camp of the then reigning prince of Persia.
The Khan of Persia, they found, had died before they set sail from
China, and his son, Ghazan Khan, reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>After the custom of the times and the people, however, the princess
was married without ado to the successor of the royal person to whom
she had been betrothed before leaving far-off Cathay. It is related
that she took her leave of the three noble Venetians, to whom she had
become like a daughter and sister, with many tears and protestations
of affection; for they had been very choice in their care of her, and
she lamented their departure with sincere sorrow and many tears.</p>

<p>Leaving the princess at the camp of the Khan (for he was now at war),
the Venetians pushed on to Tabriz, where they made a long halt,
resting and refreshing themselves after their long and wearisome
journey. Then they again took up their line of march westward, and
reached Venice, as we have seen, in November, 1295, only to find their
identity denied and their stories disbelieved, until, by an artifice,
they made themselves truly known to their fellow-townsmen, who had
long since given them up for dead.</p>

<p>Marco Polo's book, dictated by him in prison, is remarkable for its
reserve and its scantiness of all semblance of ornament in its
literary style. Messer Marco evidently did not greatly affect the arts
and graces of fine writing. Like most of the Italian gentlefolk of his
day and generation, he held the business of writing in low esteem.
Some of his chapters are very brief indeed, the text being no greater
in bulk than the headings which his amanuensis put over them of his
own motion. Of the original manuscript, written in French, copies were
made for the use of the learned, the art of printing being as yet not
invented. There are now in existence no less than eighty of these
manuscripts, in various languages, more or less differing from each
other in unimportant details; but all substantially verifying the
facts of the wonderful history of Messer Marco Polo as here set forth.
The most precious of these is known as the Geographical text,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> and is preserved in the great Paris Library; from it was
printed, in 1824, one of the most valued of the texts now in
existence. But the most useful and satisfactory of all the printed
editions is that edited and annotated by Colonel Henry Yule, and
printed in London in 1871. The first printed edition of Marco Polo's
book was in the German text, and was published in 1477.</p>

<p>Many writers have dwelt long on the question, Did Columbus gather any
information from the book of Marco Polo that aided him in forming his
theory, that one could reach India and Cathay by sailing westward from
Spain out into the Sea of Darkness? We cannot satisfactorily answer
that question. But we do know that all Europe, at the time of Marco
Polo's adventurous journey eastward, resolutely turned its back upon
the Atlantic, and looked toward Cathay and the Far Orient for a road
to the fabulous diamond mines and spice islands that were believed to
exist somewhere in the vague and mysterious East. Many philosophers,
among whom was Columbus himself, thought the globe much smaller than
it really is; but it was Columbus who was apparently charged with a
divine mission to teach the world that sailing due westward from the
Pillars of Hercules would bring the voyager to the dominions of
Prester John, the Indies, and Cipangu.</p>

<p>When Columbus set sail for his hazardous venture into the Sea of
Darkness, he was armed with letters to Prester John, the traditional
Christian prince of the Far East; and his first landfall, as we know
now, was by him supposed to be an outlying portion of that vast region
vaguely known to the explorers who followed Marco Polo, as Farther
India. But centuries rolled away before the world saw the facts of
geography as we know them, or learned to accept as true the marvellous
stories of Marco Polo, whose priceless legacy was first dimly known to
the few, and was dubbed the Romance of the Great Khan.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>SIR WILLIAM WALLACE<br>

(1270-1305)</h3>


<p>The life and exploits of this most popular national hero of the Scots
have been principally preserved in a legendary form by poetry and
tradition, and are only to a very small extent matter of contemporary
record, or illustrated by authentic documents. There is no extant
Scottish chronicler of the age of Wallace. Fordun, the earliest of his
countrymen from whom we have any account of him, is his junior by
nearly a century. Wyntoun, the next authority, is still half a century
later. His <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> chief celebrator is the metrical writer Blind
Harry, or Harry the Minstrel, whose work confesses itself by its very
form to be quite as much of a fiction as a history, and whose era, at
any rate, is supposed to be nearly two centuries subsequent to that of
his hero. Some few facts, however, may be got out of the English
annalists Trivet and Hemingford, who were the contemporaries of
Wallace.</p>

<a id="img044" name="img044"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/img044.jpg" width="250" height="349" alt="Sir William Wallace." title="">
</div>

<p>There are contradictory statements of the year of his birth, but it is
probable he was born about 1270. His family was one of some
distinction, and he is said to have been the younger of the two sons
of Sir Malcolm Wallace, of Elderslie and Auchinbothie, in the
neighborhood of Paisley. His mother, who according to one account was
Sir Malcolm's second wife, is stated by the genealogists to have been
Margaret, daughter of Sir Raynald or Reginald (other authorities say
Sir Hugh) Crawford, who held the office of Sheriff of Ayr.</p>

<p>The history of Wallace down to the year 1297 is entirely legendary,
and only to be found in the rhymes of Harry the Minstrel; though many
of the facts which Harry relates still live as popular traditions in
the localities where the scenes of them are laid, whether handed down
in that way from the time when they happened, or only derived from his
poem, which long continued to be the literary favorite of the Scottish
peasantry. Harry, who, it may be observed, professes to translate from
a Latin account written by Wallace's intimate friend and chaplain,
John Blair, makes him to have been carefully educated by his uncle, a
wealthy churchman who resided at Dunipace, in Stirlingshire, and to
have been afterward sent to the grammar-school of Dundee. Here his
first memorable act is said to have been performed; his slaughter of
the son of Selby, the English governor of the castle of Dundee, in
chastisement of an insult offered him by the unwary young man; Wallace
with his dagger struck him dead on the spot. This must have happened,
if at all, in the year 1291, after Edward I. of England had obtained
possession of all the places of strength throughout Scotland on his
recognition as Lord Paramount by the various competitors for the
crown, which had become vacant by the death of the infant Margaret,
the Maiden of Norway, in September, 1290.</p>

<p>This bold deed committed by Wallace, who in making his escape is
asserted to have laid several of young Selby's attendants as low as
their master, was immediately followed by his outlawry. He now took to
the woods, and gifted as he was with eloquence, sagacity, and other
high mental powers and accomplishments (to this the testimony of
Fordun is as express and explicit as that of his poetical biographer),
not less than with strength and height of frame and all other personal
advantages, he soon found himself at the head of a band of attached as
well as determined followers, who under his guidance often harassed
the English soldiery, both on their marches and at their stations,
plundering and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> slaying, as it might chance, with equally
little remorse. Particular spots in nearly every part of Scotland are
still famous for some deed of Wallace and his fellow-outlaws,
performed at this period of his life; but for these we must refer to
the Blind Minstrel. The woods in the neighborhood of Ayr would seem to
have been his chief haunt; and some of his most remarkable feats of
valor were exhibited in that town, in the face and in defiance of the
foreign garrison by which it was occupied. Both his father and his
elder brother are said to have fallen in <i>rencontres</i> with the English
during this interval. It was now also that he fell in love with the
orphan daughter of Sir Hew de Bradfute, the heiress of Lamington,
having, it is said, first seen her at a church in the neighborhood of
Lanark. The Scotch writers affirm that this lady, whom he appears to
have married, and who at any rate bore him a daughter, a year or two
after forming her connection with Wallace fell into the hands of his
enemies, and was barbarously executed by order of Hazelrig, the
English Sheriff or Governor of Lanark, while her husband, or lover,
was doomed to witness the spectacle from a place where he lay in
concealment. Such private injuries were well fitted to raise his
hatred to an unextinguishable flame.</p>

<p>How far the guerilla warfare maintained by Wallace and his associates
contributed to excite and spread the spirit of resistance to the
English government, we have scarcely the means of judging; but it
seems probable that it aided materially in producing the general
insurrection which broke out in the spring of 1297. The accounts we
have of the commencement of that movement represent Wallace at its
head, in command of a considerable force, and in association with some
of the most distinguished persons in the kingdom, such as the Steward
of Scotland and his brother, Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, Sir William
Douglas, etc. Soon after this he was joined by the younger Robert
Bruce (afterward King Robert I.) who had hitherto, as well as his
father, who was still alive (the son of the original competitor for
the crown), professed to adhere to the English king.</p>

<p>This, however, appears to have been but an ill-cemented confederacy.
When the force despatched by Edward to quell the revolt presented
itself before the Scottish army posted near Irvine, in Ayrshire, the
leaders of the latter, throwing off the authority of their nominal
chief, could no more agree what to do than whom to obey: and the
result was that Bruce, the Steward, Douglas, and others of them,
availing themselves of the diplomatic talents of the Bishop of
Glasgow, concluded a treaty on July 9th, by which they agreed to
acknowledge Edward as their sovereign lord. All the rest ultimately
acceded to this arrangement, except only Wallace and his friend, Sir
Andrew Moray, of Bothwell. The treaty of Irvine, which is printed by
Rymer, is, we believe, the first of the few public documents in which
mention is made of Wallace; to the instrument (which is in French) are
subjoined the words, "Escrit à Sir Willaume," the meaning of which
Lord Hailes conceives to be, "that the barons had notified Wallace
that they had made terms of accommodation for themselves and their
party." The words, moreover, on the supposition that they refer to
Wallace, of which there seems to be little doubt, show that he had
before this date obtained the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> honor of knighthood. It had
probably been bestowed upon him (as was then customary) by some other
knight, one of his companions in arms, since his elevation from being
the captain of a band of outlaws to be the commander-in-chief of the
national forces.</p>

<p>Wallace now retired to the north, carrying with him, however, a
considerable body of adherents, to whom additional numbers rapidly
gathered, so that he soon found himself in a condition to recommence
aggressive operations. Directing his force to the northeastern coast,
he surprised the castle of Dunottar, cleared Aberdeen, Forfar,
Brechin, and other towns of their English garrisons, and then laid
siege to the castle of Dundee. While he was engaged in this last
attempt, news was brought that the English army was approaching
Stirling; upon which, leaving the siege to be carried on by the
citizens of Dundee, he hastened to meet the enemy in the field. The
result was the complete defeat and rout of the English, at the battle
of Stirling Bridge, fought on September 11, 1297&mdash;a battle which once
more, for the moment, liberated Scotland. The English were immediately
driven or fled from every place of strength in the country, including
Berwick itself.</p>

<p>Availing himself of this panic and of the exhilaration of his
countrymen, Wallace pursued the fugitives across the border; and
putting himself at the head of a numerous force, he entered England on
October 18th, and, remaining till November 11th, wasted the country
with fire and sword from sea to sea, and as far south as to the walls
of Newcastle. It was during this visitation that the prior and convent
of Hexham obtained from him the protection preserved by Hemingford. It
is dated at Hexildesham (Hexham), November 7th, and runs in the names
of "Andreas de Moravia, et Wilhelmus Wallensis, duces exercitus
Scotiæ, nomine præclari principis Joannis, Dei gratia, Regis Scotia
illustris, de consensu communitatis regni ejusdem," that is, "Andrew
Moray and William Wallace, commanders-in-chief of the army of
Scotland, in the name of King John, and by consent of the community of
the said kingdom." The John here acknowledged as King of Scotland was
Baliol, now in the hands of Edward, and living in a sort of free
custody in the Tower of London. Wallace's associate in the command was
the young Sir Andrew Moray, son of his faithful friend of that name,
who had retired with him from the capitulation of Irvine, and who had
fallen at the battle of Stirling Bridge.</p>

<p>One of the most curious of the few public papers in which the name of
Wallace occurs was a few years since discovered by Dr. Lappenburg, of
Hamburg, in the archives of the ancient Hanseatic city of Lübeck. It
is a letter, in Latin, addressed to the authorities of Lübeck and
Hamburg, informing them that their merchants should now have free
access to all ports of the kingdom of Scotland, seeing that the said
kingdom, by the favor of God, had been recovered by war from the power
of the English. The letter is dated "apud Badsing tonam" (the true
word, it has been suggested, is probably Haddingtonam), October 11,
1297, that is, a few days before the invasion of Cumberland and
Northumberland. It is in the name of "Andreas de Moravia et Willelmus
Wallensis, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> duces exercitis regni Scotiæ, et communitas,
eiusdem regni"&mdash;like the Hexham protection&mdash;but without any mention of
King John.</p>

<p>After his triumphal return from his incursion into England, Wallace
assumed the title of Guardian of the Kingdom in the name of King John,
whether formally invested with that dignity or only hailed as such by
the gratitude of his countrymen. In a charter, printed in Anderson's
"Diplomata," conferring the constabulary of Dundee on Alexander
Skirmischur (Scrimgeour) and his heirs, and dated at Torphichen (in
the county of Linlithgow) March 29, 1298, he styles himself,
"Willelmus Walays miles, Custos Regni Scotiæ, et ductor exercituum
ejusdem, nomine præclari principis Domini Johannis, Dei gratia Regis
Scotiæ illustris, de consensu communitatis ejusdem." The grant is
stated to have been made with the consent and approbation of the
nobility ("per consensum et assensum magnatum dicti regni.")</p>

<p>But this supreme elevation did not last long. Supported only by his
own merits and the admiration and attachment of his humbler
fellow-countrymen, Wallace, a new man, and without family connection,
would probably have found it difficult or impossible to retain his
high place, even if he had had nothing more to contend with than
domestic jealousy and dissatisfaction. Fordun relates that many of the
nobility were in the habit of saying, "We will not have this man to
rule over us." Meanwhile the energetic English king, who had been
abroad when the defeat of Stirling Bridge lost him Scotland, had now
returned home, and was already on his march toward the borders at the
head of a powerful army. A body of English, which had landed in the
north of Fife, led by Aymer de Vallois, Earl of Pembroke, is said by
the Scottish authorities to have been attacked and routed by Wallace
on June 12, 1298, in the forest of Blackironside, in that county; but
when the two main armies met on July 22d, in the neighborhood of
Falkirk&mdash;the Scots commanded by Wallace, the English by their king in
person&mdash;the former, after a gallant and obstinate resistance, were at
last forced to give way, and the battle ended in a universal rout
accompanied with immense slaughter.</p>

<p>This defeat did not put an end to the war; but it was taken advantage
of by the Scottish nobility to deprive Wallace of his office of
guardian or chief governor of the kingdom. The Scottish accounts say
that he voluntarily resigned the supreme power; it is certain, at any
rate, that Bruce, his rival Comyn, and Lamberton, Bishop of St.
Andrew's, were now appointed joint guardians of Scotland, still in the
name of Baliol. For some years after this our accounts of Wallace are
slight and obscure; but he appears to have returned with a chosen band
of followers to the practice of the desultory warfare in which he had
originally distinguished himself. The legendary histories continue to
detail his deeds of prowess performed in harassing the enemy both on
their marches and in their camps and strongholds. And to fill up the
story, they also make him to have paid two visits to France&mdash;the first
in 1300, the second in 1302. The next well-ascertained fact regarding
him is that when the Scottish leaders were at last obliged to submit
to Edward at Strathorde, on February 9, 1304, Wallace was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span>
not included in the capitulation, one of the clauses of which (printed
in the original French in Ryley's "Placeta Parliamentaria") is to the
effect that as for Wallace (Monsieur Guillaume de Galeys), he might,
if he pleased, give himself up to the king's mercy ("quil se mette en
la voluntè et en la grace nostre seigneur le Roy, si lui semble, que
bon soit"). He was soon after summoned to appear before a parliament
or convention of Scotch and English nobility, held at St. Andrew's;
and upon their not presenting themselves, he and Sir Simon Frisel, or
Fraser, were pronounced outlaws. For some time his retreat remained
undiscovered, although his active hostility still continued
occasionally to make itself felt. A principal person employed in the
attempts to capture him appears to have been Ralph de Haliburton; but
how he was actually taken is not known. Sir John Menteith (a son of
Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith), to whose treachery his delivery to
the English king is attributed by Blind Harry and popular tradition,
appears to have really done nothing more than forward him to England
after he was brought a prisoner to Dumbarton Castle, of which Menteith
was governor under a commission from Edward.</p>

<p>On being brought to London, Wallace was lodged in the house of William
Delect, a citizen, in Fenchurch Street; and on the next day, being the
eve of St. Bartholomew, he was brought on horseback to Westminster,
and in the hall there, "being placed on the south bench," says Stow,
"crowned with laurel for that he had said in times past that he ought
to bear a crown in that all," he was arraigned as a traitor, and on
that charge found guilty, and condemned to death. After being dragged
to the usual place of execution&mdash;the Elms, in West Smithfield&mdash;at the
tails of his horses, he was there hanged on a high gallows, on August
23, 1305, after which he was "drawn and quartered." His right arm was
set up at Newcastle, his left at Berwick; his right leg at Perth, his
left at Aberdeen; his head on London Bridge. Wallace's daughter, by
the heiress of Lamington, married Sir William Bailie, of Hoprig, whose
descendants through her inherited the estate of Lamington.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>



<h3>ROBERT BRUCE<br>

By <span class="smcap">Sir J. Bernard Burke, LL.D.</span><br>

(1274-1329)</h3>


<p>Robert Bruce was born in the year 1274, on the Feast of the
translation of St. Benedict, being March 21st, and was undoubtedly of
Norman origin. In an annual roll containing the names of those knights
and barons who came over with William the Conqueror, we find that of
Brueys; and from the Domesday Book it appears that a family of the
same name were possessed of lands in Yorkshire. Coming down to a later
period, 1138, when David I. of Scotland made his fatal attack
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> upon England&mdash;fatal, that is, to himself and his people&mdash;the
English barons, previous to the battle of Cutton Moor, near
Northallerton, sent a message to the Scottish king, by Robert Bruce,
of Cleveland, a Norman knight, who possessed estates in either
country. Upon his death, this knight bequeathed his English lands to
his eldest son, and those in Annandale to his younger, who received a
confirmation of his title by a charter of William the Lion. From this
root sprung Robert Bruce, the competitor for the crown with Baliol,
whose grandson was the more celebrated Robert Bruce, the younger, Earl
of Carrick in virtue of his mother's title, and afterward King of
Scotland. He was the eldest of three brothers and seven sisters, whose
marriages with some of the leading families of Scotland proved an
important element of success to the future hero. His earliest years
were passed at the castle of Turnberry, where his mother resided; but
as he grew older, his father, who considered himself an English baron,
thought proper that he should be removed to the English court. The
friendship subsisting between Edward the First and the Earl of Carrick
induced the former to adopt the earl's son; so that the confiding
monarch trained up his mortal enemy in the use of those arts and
weapons which were one day to be turned against himself.</p>

<a id="img045" name="img045"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img045.jpg" width="250" height="304" alt="Robert Bruce." title="">
</div>

<p>The family of Bruce, as we have already noticed, were competitors for
the Scottish throne with Baliol, in whose favor an award was
pronounced by Edward, when called upon to arbitrate between them. At
this time the elder Bruce was far advanced in years; his son, the Earl
of Carrick, was still in the prime of life, and his grandson, Robert
Bruce was eighteen years of age. Upon the old man being required to do
homage for his lands in Scotland to the new monarch of that country,
he indignantly refused, exclaiming, "I am Baliol's sovereign, not
Baliol mine; and rather than consent to such a homage, I resign my
lands in Annandale to my son, the Earl of Carrick." But Carrick was
not less proud, or averse to anything that might call in question his
claim to the crown of Scotland, and in like manner refused to hold any
lands of Baliol. As, however, according to the feudal law, he must
either divest himself of his estate, or do homage for it, he adopted
the former alternative, and resigned the lands of Annandale in favor
of his son, Robert. The young baron, less scrupulous than his
relatives, did not hesitate to accept his father's gift, which, upon
feudal principles, carried with it the title of Earl of Carrick, and
did homage for the same to Baliol. By his father's death, in 1304, he
became possessed of the family estates in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> From this time Bruce played his part with skill, though in
justice it must be allowed that his patriotism was not altogether
without the alloy of a selfish ambition; and perhaps it would be
expecting too much from human nature, even in its best and highest
forms, to look for anything else. Neither can we free him from the
charge of dissimulation in that he swore a fealty to Baliol, which it
is plain he never intended to observe, and affected gratitude and
attachment for the English monarch, while in secret he was preparing
to undermine him. An excuse for this has been sought by his more
partial admirers in the necessity of the case, arising from the
well-known sagacity of Edward, who would otherwise have penetrated his
purposes and crushed them in the bud without scruple. Nor was this the
only obstacle in his path to empire. Upon the failure of Baliol and
his only son, Edward, the ancient and powerful family of the Comyns
were ready to dispute his title to the crown, which they claimed for
themselves. John, commonly called the Red Comyn, who had been the
determined opponent of Wallace, possessed, in the event of the monarch
dying without issue, the same right to the throne which was vested in
Bruce himself. He, too, had connected himself by marriage with the
royal family of England, and was at this time one of the most powerful
subjects in Scotland. When Baliol leagued with Comyn to throw off the
supremacy of Edward, whose hand, whether justly or not, had raised him
to the Scottish throne, the Bruces and their party, tempted by the
promise of a crown, lent their best aid to the English monarch. Upon
the termination of the campaign the elder Bruce demanded the
fulfilment of Edward's promise, to which the latter indignantly
replied that he had not come into Scotland to conquer a kingdom for
him; so that Bruce reaped nothing else at the time from his service,
than the satisfaction of seeing his rival, Baliol, dethroned, and the
influence of the Comyns effectually diminished.</p>

<p>In 1296 Edward held a parliament at Berwick, compelling the Scotch
barons to do him homage, and the young lord of Carrick concurred in
the national submission. But notwithstanding this outward show of
fealty, he became, in the time of Wallace's success, suspected of
entertaining designs upon the crown. At first, indeed, he had joined
against Wallace, and wasted the lands of his adherent, Douglas, with
fire and sword; yet, soon after his return home, he summoned the
Annandale men, who were the vassals of his father, then in the service
of Edward, and thus addressed them: "You have already heard, without
doubt, of that solemn oath, which I lately took at Carlisle, and I
cannot deny the fact; but the oath was a foolish one, and exacted by
fear; it was my body that took the oath, and not my mind; but its
having been taken at all is now to me the cause of much remorse and
sorrow; yet erelong I hope to be absolved from it by our Holy Father.
In the meanwhile, I am resolved to go and join my fellow-countrymen,
and assist them in their efforts to restore to its liberty the land of
my nativity, for none, as you know, is an enemy of his own flesh, and
as for me, I love my people. Let me beseech you, then, to adopt the
same resolution, and you shall ever be esteemed my most dear friends
and approved counsellors."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> To this request the men of Annandale deferred giving any
answer till the morning, and took advantage of the night to retire, so
that Bruce could only join the insurgents with his own vassals of
Carrick.</p>

<p>The first disappointment might have taught Bruce to desist from his
design, for which the time was not yet ripe; but blinded by ambition,
he entered into a strict alliance with Wishart, the Bishop of Glasgow,
and the Steward of Scotland, the principal leaders of the
insurrection. Upon joining his new associates, he found their purposes
utterly incompatible with his views upon the crown. Wallace, the soul
of the party, had ever supported the claims of Baliol, and his great
supporter, Sir Andrew Moray, a near connection of the Comyns, had the
same object. During the campaign, therefore, of 1298, which concluded
with the battle of Falkirk, Bruce shut himself up in his castle of
Ayr, maintaining a cautious neutrality, while his father continued to
reside in England and to serve Edward in his wars. The king, however,
did not admire this cold system of neutrality. He in consequence
determined to attack the castle of Ayr, and Bruce, dreading the
consequences, razed it to the ground, and sought an asylum in the
mountain fastnesses of Carrick.</p>

<p>In the following year, when Wallace had resigned the regency, John
Comyn, of Badenoch, and Sir John de Soulis, were chosen governors of
the kingdom, and the party of Bruce availed themselves of the
opportunity to advance his influence by opposition to those in power,
and by defeating every measure taken for the public benefit. An
attempt was made by those who really wished well to the national
cause, or who dreaded that their disunion might be fatal to all alike,
to reconcile the contending factions; with this view they elected
Bruce, and Lamberton, Bishop of Glasgow, joint regents in the name of
Baliol; but this ill-assorted coalition soon fell to pieces, as might
have been expected, where the views which one party entertained in
secret were so utterly opposed to the avowed purposes of all.</p>

<p>The policy which actuated Bruce on this occasion may be easily
explained. It was clear that Edward would never consent to the
restoration of Baliol, then in exile, and the Comyns had taken so
decided a part against him, that it seemed most improbable he would
ever consent to raise one of that family to the throne. Continuing,
therefore, the same line of duplicity with which he had commenced, and
which he had only abandoned for a single instant in the vain hope of
persuading the party of Wallace to openly adopt his claims, he now
endeavored by submission and affected attachment to win the favor of
the English monarch. Edward, he well knew, had the power, could he be
brought to entertain the inclination, to place him on the Scottish
throne, and if this point were once attained, Bruce trusted that means
would afterward occur of shaking off all dependence upon his
benefactor. In these designs he to a certain extent succeeded, but not
in his main object. If he was crafty, Edward was yet craftier. He had
fallen into the same error that his father had, in 1296, and was
outwitted by the superior political ability of him whom he had
intended to deceive, and who, it must be confessed, was equally
insincere. Edward cheated both father and son, by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span> holding
out to them the hope of a crown he never meant them to attain, his
object being to unite the two countries; an excellent purpose in
itself, if we could only bring ourselves to overlook the fraud and
violence by which it was to be accomplished. When, therefore, the
Comyns submitted, in 1304, and he proceeded to the settlement of his
new dominions, the Earl of Carrick found that his only gain was the
being employed among the commissioners in organizing a system of
government. He had, however, reaped no little advantage from his
dissimulation. While Baliol was an exile and Comyn in disgrace, he had
preserved his estates, and won the king's confidence without losing,
but rather augmenting, his influence with the Scotch. At the same time
he saw that Comyn was still powerful; his claims to the throne were
more generally admitted by the people, and without his concurrence
nothing could be effected. Thus situated, Bruce submitted to his rival
this alternative: "Give me your land, and I shall bind myself to
support your title to the kingdom, and, when we have expelled our
enemies, to place the crown upon your head; or, if thou dost not
choose to assume the state of the kingdom, here am I ready to resign
to you my estates, on condition that you second me in my efforts to
regain the throne of my fathers." Comyn accepted the latter
alternative, but immediately betrayed the design to Edward, and sent
him the letter, or indenture, by which Bruce had bound himself. But
the latter, when suddenly charged with it, denied his hand and seal
with a coolness that could only belong to one long practised in the
arts of dissimulation, and demanded time to prove his innocence.
Arch-deceiver as the English king himself was, he yet allowed himself
to be duped by this specious effrontery, and Bruce escaping into
Scotland, murdered Comyn in the church of the Grey Friars, at
Dumfries. Soon afterward he was crowned at Scone, and the revolution
spread far and wide; upon hearing which, Edward sent an invading army
into Scotland. Superiority of force and military skill soon compelled
Bruce to retreat to the mountain fastnesses, that offered a better
place of security than the strongest castle, for castles might be
stormed; but here, if danger threatened him at one point, he had only
to retreat to one more remote and more rugged, and thus at any time
was enabled to baffle his pursuers when he found them too powerful to
be resisted. A series of fights&mdash;battles they could hardly be
called&mdash;and adventures now ensued which have all the coloring of
romance, but which entailed so much of hardness and privation upon his
followers, that after a while it became evident he would not be able
much longer to keep them from abandoning a cause so desperate. Then,
again, a spark of hope was kindled by the disaffection growing out of
the severity which Edward exercised upon all who had been in arms to
resist him. Numbers in consequence flocked to Bruce, and fresh
adventures succeeded of a yet more romantic nature than those already
mentioned; the fortunes of the wanderer seeming now to be at the
lowest ebb, and then again rising into a prosperous flood, which as
rapidly subsided, making it a matter of some difficulty for him to
escape being stranded by the falling waters. It was during this season
that Douglas disgraced himself and the Scottish name by barbarities
that have never been surpassed, and rarely even equalled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> The death of the great Edward&mdash;for great he was, in spite of
all his faults&mdash;and the accession of his son, the feeble Edward II.,
left an open field to Bruce, who was as much superior to those that
now opposed him, as he had been overcrowned by the genius of his late
adversary. He marched from victory to victory, and would, no doubt,
have brought the contest to a happy termination, had he not been
seized by an alarming sickness. At first, it threatened to be fatal;
things were again beginning to look gloomy for Scotland; but in the
moment of extreme peril, he shook off his disease by a strong effort,
and once more led his followers through a series of triumphs, which
were crowned by the great battle of Bannockburn. Though we cannot
allow the ambition which seeks a crown to pass for patriotism, it is
impossible to deny the highest praise to the courage, firmness, and
ability displayed by Bruce through the whole of this trying period.
None may deny that he deserved a crown, and when once obtained, it
acquired a lustre from the talents of him who wore it.</p>

<p>Bruce soon found himself in a condition to assist his brother Edward
in the attempt to drive the English out of Ireland. But here the usual
good fortune of the Scotch abandoned them. After a hard-fought
campaign, attended by many vicissitudes, his sagacity saw that the
attempt was hopeless, and he returned to Scotland. Shortly afterward,
the turbulent and aspiring Edward Bruce was slain in battle.</p>

<p>His wonted success attended Bruce in the field, in the midst of which,
however, a plot was formed against his life and government.
Fortunately it was revealed in time by the Countess of Strathearn, to
whom the conspirators had the weakness to confide their intentions;
and soon afterward, to crown his prosperity, Edward II. was compelled
by a series of defeats to conclude a peace. But Bruce's health began
to be impaired, and when war again broke out between the countries,
upon the deposition of Edward II. and the succession of his son,
Edward III., he was unable to lead his projected expedition against
England. It ended in failure, if not in defeat.</p>

<p>A short interval of health and hope gleamed upon him after this
attack, and peace was concluded between the two countries, greatly to
the dissatisfaction of the English, who, justly enough, considered
themselves sacrificed to the ambition of the queen-mother, Isabella,
and of her favorite, Mortimer. But this momentary promise of health
and vigor soon passed away, and it became plain to all that the life
of this brave and sagacious monarch was drawing rapidly to a close. In
expectation of the final event he had given orders to have a
magnificent tomb made at Paris; which was brought to Bruges, thence
through England into Scotland, and on its arrival erected in the
church of the Benedictines at Dunfermline.</p>

<p>Bruce died in his fifty-fifth year, and was buried in the abbey-church
of Dunfermline, as he had desired.</p>

<p>In the prime of his life Bruce was upward of six feet high; his
shoulders were broad, his chest full and open; the cheek-bones strong
and prominent, and the muscles of the back and neck of great size and
thickness; his hair curled short over a broad forehead, and the
general expression of his face was calm and cheerful; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>(p. 111)</span> yet,
when he pleased, he could assume a character of stern command. Such,
at least, Bruce has been described by the old historian, and we may
easily believe it, since the outward semblance agrees so well with
what is recorded of his life and actions.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>ARNOLD VON WINKELRIED<br>

(DIED, 1386)</h3>


<a id="img046" name="img046"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img046.jpg" width="300" height="218" alt="Arnold von Winkelried." title="">
</div>

<p>The incident with which this name is connected is, after the purely
legendary feat of Tell, the best known and most popular in the early
history of the Swiss Confederation. We are told how, at a critical
moment in the great battle of Sempach, when the Swiss had failed to
break the serried ranks of the Austrian knights, a man of Unterwalden,
Arnold von Winkelried by name, came to the rescue. Commending his wife
and children to the care of his comrades, he rushed toward the
Austrians, gathered a number of their spears together against his
breast, and fell pierced through, having opened a way into the hostile
ranks for his fellow-countrymen, though at the price of his own life.
But the Tell and Winkelried stories stand in a very different position
when looked at in the dry light of history; for, while in the former
imaginary and impossible men (bearing now and then a real historical
name) do imaginary and impossible deeds at a very uncertain period, in
the latter we have some solid ground to rest on, and Winkelried's act
might very well have been performed, though, as yet, the amount of
genuine and early evidence in support of it is very far from being
sufficient.</p>

<p>The Winkelrieds of Stanz were a knightly family when we first hear of
them, though toward the end of the fourteenth century they seem to
have been but simple men without the honors of knighthood, and not
always using their prefix "von." Among its members we find an Erni
Winkelried acting as a witness to a contract of sale on May 1, 1367;
while the same man, or perhaps another member of the family, Erni von
Winkelried, is plaintiff in a suit at Stanz, on September 29, 1389,
and in 1417 is the landamman (or head-man) of Unterwalden, being then
called Arnold Winkelriet. We have, therefore, a real man named Arnold
Winkelried living at Stanz, about the time of the battle of Sempach.
The question is thus narrowed to the points, was he present at the
battle, and did he then perform the deed commonly attributed to him?
The determination of this question requires a minute investigation of
the history of that battle, to ascertain if <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span> there are any
authentic traces of this incident, or any opportunity for it to have
taken place.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Evidence of Chronicles.</span>&mdash;The earliest known mention of the incident
is found in a Zurich chronicle (discovered in 1862 by Herr G. von
Wyss), which is a copy, made in 1476, of a chronicle written in, or at
any rate not earlier than, 1438, though it is wanting in the sixteenth
century transcript of another chronicle written in 1466, which up to
1389 closely agrees with the former. It appears in the well-known
form, but the hero is stated to be "ein getrüwer man under den
Eidgenozen," no name being given, and it seems clear that his death
did not take place at that time. No other mention has been found in
any of the numerous Swiss or Austrian chronicles, till we come to the
book "De Helvetiæ Origine," written in 1538 by Rudolph Gwalther
(Zwingli's son-in-law), when the hero is still nameless, being
compared to Decius or Codrus, but is said to have been killed by his
brave act. Finally we read the full story in the original draft of
Giles Tschudi's chronicle, where the hero is described "as a man of
Unterwalden, of the Winkelried family," this being expanded in the
first rescension of the chronicle (1564) into "a man of Unterwalden,
Arnold von Winkelried by name, a brave knight;" while he is entered
(in the same book, on the authority of the "Anniversary Book" of
Stanz, now lost) on the list of those who fell at Sempach, at the head
of the Nidwald (or Stanz) men, as "Herr Arnold von Winkelried,
ritter," this being in the first draft "Arnold Winckelriet."</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Ballads.</span>&mdash;There are several war songs on the battle of Sempach
which have come down to us, but in one only is there mention of
Winkelried and his deed. This is a long ballad of sixty-seven
four-line stanzas, part of which (including the Winkelried section) is
found in the additions made between 1531 and 1545 to Etterlin's
chronicle by H. Berlinger of Basel, and the whole in Werner Steiner's
chronicle (written 1532). It is agreed on all sides that the last
stanza, attributing the authorship to Halbsuter, of Lucerne, "as he
came back from the battle," is a very late addition. Many authorities
regard it as made up of three distinct songs (one of which refers to
the battle and Winkelried), possibly put together by the younger
Halbsuter (citizen of Lucerne in 1435, died between 1470 and 1480);
though others contend that the Sempach-Winkelried section bears clear
traces of having been composed after the Reformation began, that is,
about 1520 or 1530. Some recent discoveries have proved that certain
statements in the song, usually regarded as anachronisms, are quite
accurate; but no nearer approach has been made toward fixing its exact
date, or that of any of the three bits into which it has been cut up.
In this song the story appears in its full-blown shape, the name of
Winckelriet being given.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>In the history of the world since the dawn of time, there is no other
character so remarkable to me as that of Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>You have but to think of any young girl of your acquaintance,
seventeen years old, and try to imagine her leading an army to battle,
storming a fort, or planning a campaign, in order to realize in a
measure the astounding qualities possessed by this wonderful being.</p>

<p>Not only did she do all this as wisely as the most astute general who
ever lived, but she succeeded in liberating France from the hands of
the English, where we have very good reason to think it might have
otherwise remained to this day; for the English were gaining ground
steadily, and the French dauphin was utterly discouraged, and had
ceased to make an effort to maintain his rights, when Joan of Arc came
to his rescue.</p>

<p>The English king, Henry V., had died in the midst of his triumphs. Two
months later, imbecile Charles VI., of France, passed away also, and
Henry VI., of England, was proclaimed king of both nations; while at
the same time the dauphin was hailed King of France by his few
followers. But his fortunes were at the lowest ebb, his small army,
stationed at Orleans, was in need of food. Four thousand of his men
went out to search for provisions, and encountered half that number of
English soldiers. A battle ensued, and five hundred of the bravest
French soldiers were left dead on the field of strife. Despite their
bravery, hunger and fatigue had unfitted them to combat with their
well-fed adversaries.</p>

<p>The dauphin had shut himself in the castle of Chinon, with fair women
and gay comrades, while the siege was raging before the walls of
Orleans. He was at that time a weak and vacillant youth, given over to
the same pleasures and vices which drove his father mad and caused his
brother's death. He had no pride in rescuing his crown from the
English, and it must be confessed that the treatment he had received
from his own mother and his own countrymen, who sold him to the enemy,
was sufficient to dishearten a stronger nature than his. Added to
this, he was doubtful of his legitimate right to the throne, owing to
his mother's depraved career. But when, in the midst of his orgies,
the news was brought to him, in the castle of Chinon, that his army
was defeated before the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> walls of Orleans, what little hope
or courage he had left seemed to desert him and he sank into a state
of despair.</p>

<p>And far away on the frontier, in the little village of Domremy, a
young girl watched her flocks, and wept over the fate of her beloved
country; and weeping, prayed that God would save France from the
oppressor. How earnestly she prayed, and how well God listened,
history has recorded in a tale more wonderful than any story ever
conceived by the imagination of man, and sadder than any other save
the story of the Nazarene upon the Cross of Calvary.</p>

<p>The end of France as a nation seemed at hand. The nobility had been
led into captivity and sold to an invading enemy; the clergy had seen
its altars defamed by arrogant strangers. Industry had been ruined by
civil wars during the long imbecility of Charles VI., and the
succeeding ravages made by the English. Villages were depopulated,
homes desolated, and look where they might, the people of France saw
no hope of aid, save from on high.</p>

<p>Of this epoch Henry Martin says, "The people expected nothing from
human sources; but a sentiment of indestructible nationality stirred
in their hearts and told them that France could not die. Hoping
nothing from earth, they lifted their souls to heaven; an ardent
religious fervor seized upon them, which had no part with clergy or
creed. It rose from the extremity of their need, and fixed its root in
an old oracle of the Middle Ages, which had predicted that France
should be 'lost through a woman and saved by a virgin.'"</p>

<p>France had certainly been lost through its wicked queen; that part of
the old prophecy had been fearfully fulfilled; the remaining clause
was yet to be verified. The people, excited to a religious frenzy by
their desperate straits and their faith in the old superstition,
prayed more fervently with each day; and their prayers rose like great
white eagles and settled upon the heart of that strange divine child,
who was weeping over the fate of France while she watched her sheep on
the plains of Domremy.</p>

<p>A humbly born girl was Joan of Arc, unable to read or write; women who
could do more than that were rare in those days, so she was not
despised on account of her ignorance, but highly respected for her
industry and piety. An enthusiastic Catholic, she added to her church
duties by active benevolence and kindness to the sick and poor in her
native town. Often she was seen to kneel in the fields and pray; and
there was a chapel some miles from Domremy to which she used to make a
pilgrimage every Sunday and offer prayers to the Virgin. There was,
too, in the forest of Bois Chemin a famous beech-tree under which a
stream of clear water flowed; and a superstition prevailed among the
people of Domremy that fairies had blessed this tree and bestowed
healing properties upon the waters of the stream. The priest and the
villagers marched about the sacred tree once each year singing solemn
chants, and the young people hung its boughs with garlands, and danced
under its shading branches. Joan dearly loved this spot, and it became
her favorite haunt. The echoes of war reverberated even to this quiet
frontier hamlet, and in her hours of reverie she dwelt sadly upon the
stories of bloodshed and suffering which she heard her elders repeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> She was twelve years old when the dauphin was proclaimed king
by his few followers; and in all his flight from province to province,
fleeing before the usurpers of his throne, no heart in all France
suffered more keenly than the heart beating in the breast of this
humble shepherd girl. The misfortunes of the dauphin, the woes of her
country, took complete possession of her expanding mind. Her pure
young soul yearned toward the Infinite in one ceaseless prayer; and
when any soul is so lifted up above all thought of self, praying for
the good of others, a response never fails to come. It is only selfish
prayers which remain unanswered. Joan's beautiful nature was like the
sensitive plate prepared to receive the impression; and while she
prayed the angels to save France, the angels prepared her to become
the saviour.</p>

<p>One summer day, when she was in her fourteenth year, she was running
in the fields with her companions, when, as she afterward declared,
"she felt herself lifted as by an invisible force and carried along as
if she possessed wings." Her companions gazed upon her with
astonishment, seeing her fly beyond their reach. Then she heard a
voice, which proceeded from a great light above her; and the voice
said, "Joan, put your trust in God, and go and save France."</p>

<p>This strange experience filled her with terror; but ere many days she
heard the voice again, and this time she saw the figure of a winged
angel. "I am the Archangel Michael," the voice said, "and the
messenger of God, who bids you to go to the aid of the dauphin and
restore him to his throne."</p>

<p>Overcome with fear, she fell on her knees in tears; but the angel
continued to appear to her, accompanied with two female forms, and
always urging her to go to the aid of her country. Fear gave place to
ecstacy, and in the heart of this divine child awoke the audacious
idea whose climax astounded the whole world.</p>

<p>At first she reasoned with the voices, telling them "she was but a
poor girl, who knew nothing of men or war." But the voices replied,
"Go and save France; God will be with you, and you have nothing to
fear."</p>

<p>During three years she listened to these voices, which made themselves
heard by her two or three times each week. She seemed consumed by an
inward fever, and strange words escaped her. One day she said to a
laborer, that "midway between Coussi and Vaucouleurs there lived a
maid who should bring the dauphin to his throne."</p>

<p>These words were repeated to her father and they alarmed him; and we
cannot wonder that they did. How could he think otherwise than that
his little girl was losing her senses? How could he dream of the
divine and superhuman powers that had descended upon her from a higher
world? He told her brother that if Joan should attempt to follow the
army, as he feared she might, "he would rather drown her with his own
hands." Her parents set a watch upon her movements, and decided to
marry her to a young man who was secretly enamored of her. They
connived with this admirer to swear before an officer of the law that
Joan had promised him her heart; but she so strenuously denied the
assertion before the judge that she gained her case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span> Just at this epoch the people of Domremy were obliged to fly
before an invading troop of soldiers. When they returned to their
village they found their church burned and their homes pillaged. Joan
regarded this as a direct punishment for her hesitation in heeding the
"voices." She would hesitate no longer, and after repeated delays and
disheartening rebuffs, she succeeded in winning her way, with a few
believers in her mission, to the king's castle.</p>

<p>When Charles finally consented to an interview, he disguised one of
his courtiers as king, and he was disguised as a courtier; but Joan
was not deceived by clothing; she fell at his feet, clasped his knees,
and exclaimed, "Gentle king, God has taken pity on you and your
people; the angels are on their knees praying for you and them."</p>

<p>The king was impressed with her lofty enthusiasm, and plied her with
questions. Her responses astonished him. One reliable authority tells
us that she revealed to him something known only to himself&mdash;and
answered a question which he had that day demanded of God in the
privacy of prayer&mdash;the question of his legitimate right to the throne.
Joan told him that he had asked this question of God, and that she was
able to reply to it in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The king was so astonished and overjoyed at this proof of the maiden's
powers, that he expressed belief in her divine mission; but he quickly
relapsed into doubt again, and Joan was obliged to endure a very
critical examination before a parliament, where she confused and
confounded the learned doctors by her simple words: "I know not A or
B, but I am commanded by my voices to raise the siege of Orleans and
crown the dauphin at Rheims." When one aggressive doctor, with a bad
accent, asked sarcastically; "what language her voices spoke," she
replied, "Better than yours, sir," which brought the laughter of the
whole parliament upon him. A messenger sent to Domremy, to ascertain
the early conduct of the maid, returned with accounts of her piety and
benevolence. All this worked in her favor, together with the strong
faith which the masses reposed in her; for the people remembered the
old prophecy and believed that the maiden had come to deliver France.</p>

<p>Even the doctors of theology were affected by this prophecy, and the
result was the final equipment of Joan for battle. When arrayed in a
knight's armor she refused to accept a sword. "The voices told me,"
she said, "that in the church vault at Fierbois there lies a sword
marked with five crosses which I must carry, and no other."</p>

<p>A messenger was sent, who found the sword exactly as she had described
it. This naturally swelled the faith of the people in her divine
mission. She ordered a white banner made, covered with the lilies of
France, and with the inscription, "Jesus Maria," emblazoned upon it.
At the end of two months she entered the town of Blois, where the army
was stationed, seated upon a fine horse, her head bare, her dark curls
streaming in the wind, an air of triumph and joy on her face. Six
thousand soldiers were drawn up to receive her. But the
pleasure-loving young dauphin, be it said to his shame, was enjoying
himself in his castle and was not there to meet her. Nothing had yet
been decided about the position <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> Joan was to occupy, but the
wild enthusiasm of the army at once made her its leader.</p>

<p>The very first act of this pure being was an attempt to uplift the
moral status of the army. Women of evil repute were sent away with
good advice, and the men were called to battle by prayer and
confession. Coarse soldiers followed her to mass, fascinated by her
peculiar spell, and rough language was silenced in her presence.
Remarkable as has seemed Joan's career up to this point, it was simple
compared to the miracles which ensued. Modest as the simplest maiden
in private life, gentle as a child in all matters pertaining to
herself, utterly devoid of self-seeking interests, she was yet enabled
to plan campaigns, direct attacks and lead armies with all the skill
of any world-renowned general. In the dead of night, with a band of
200 men, she entered the beleaguered city of Orleans in the face of
the English enemy. The inhabitants crowded about her, regarding her
rightly with wonder and awe. Her first act was to hasten to a
cathedral where the Te Deum was being chanted by torch-light. She then
selected her home with a lady of spotless reputation, in order that
all her hours of repose might be guarded from suspicions of evil. The
following day she directed a letter of warning to be sent to the
English, urging them to retreat before compelled to do so by the "fire
of Heaven." She then reconnoitred the city, determining in her mind
where to begin the attack; and as she saw no signs that the English
had taken heed of her letter, she finally mounted the walls of the
town, and in a loud voice warned the English to depart before
overtaken with the shame and disaster in store for them. To this the
English responded with insults and ribald words, and told her to "Go
home and keep her cows." Joan wept at their insults to her modesty,
and would have at once opened an attack, had she not been dissuaded by
her generals, who begged her to await the arrival of her army.</p>

<p>Despite their bold words, the English were so influenced by Joan's
peculiar power, that they allowed her army to enter Orleans with a
convoy of provisions, and made no resistance. They seemed to be
paralyzed with fear, and many of them expressed a belief that she was
aided by the devil. Although the maid was immensely popular with the
army, a lurking secret jealousy of her was already at work in the
breasts of some of her officers; and these men chose an hour when she
was taking a brief repose, to open an attack upon the English, hoping
to take the glory of a conquest to themselves. But Joan's Voices awoke
her, and told her the blood of France was being spilled; and seizing
her white banner, she mounted her horse, and rushed into the strife,
turning the tide of battle at once in favor of the French army, which
had already suffered loss. Wherever the white flag was seen, a
superhuman strength seemed to take possession of the men; and after a
fierce battle of three hours, the bastile of St. Loup was won by the
French.</p>

<p>The bastile des Augustins fell next, and here Joan was slightly
wounded in the foot; but she resolved to attack the only remaining
hold of the English the following day. Her officers counselled
together and reported themselves unfavorable to this project, as the
bastile des Tournelles was very strong, and filled <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> with the
bravest of the English army. But Joan replied, "I, too, have been at
council with God, and we shall fight to-morrow."</p>

<p>They did fight, the English with fury, the French "as if they believed
themselves immortal." After three hours of warfare Joan saw her men
hesitate under the fierce attack of the enemy. She seized a ladder,
planted it against a wall, and began to ascend it. At that moment an
English arrow struck her between the neck and shoulder, and she fell
to the ground. The disheartened soldiers bore her from the field, and
dressed her wound, from which she extracted the arrow with her own
hand, shedding womanly tears meanwhile. After the wound was dressed, a
vision came to her, and with sudden strength she remounted her horse
and rode back to battle.</p>

<p>The English, believing her nearly dead from her wound, were terrified
to see her return, and lost courage from that moment; while the
French, electrified by her unexpected presence, fought with such zeal
that before nightfall the maid led her army into Orleans crowned with
triumph. It was only seven days since she had entered the city, and
Joan had already verified her assertion that she could and would
"raise the siege of Orleans."</p>

<p>The indolent and unworthy dauphin, however, refused to go to Rheims
and be crowned and so fulfil the second part of Joan's mission. He
said there were ports along the Loire which needed to be taken first
so the girl general laid out her campaign and added Beaugency and
Jargeau to her other conquests. The English had become filled with
superstitious fear of her power, attributing it to the devil. But the
Dauphin of France still dallied with light women in his castle, and
treated Joan with coldness and suspicion. The army now became so
unanimous in the desire that the king should go to Rheims, that he
finally, with reluctance, consented. On July 16th, after having taken
Troyes and Chalons on the way, the French army entered Rheims; and
there, on the following day, the dauphin was anointed with holy oil
and received the crown of France.</p>

<p>Happy, but modest and humble in her happiness, rejoicing only in the
prosperity of the king and the country, the sublime saviour of her
land knelt before her sovereign after the ceremonies were concluded
and said, "Gentle king, I wish now that I might return toward my
father and my mother, to keep my flocks and my herds as heretofore."
Alas for the happiness of the poor girl and the honor of two
countries, that her request was not granted!</p>

<p>Joan's father was present on this occasion, and the inn where he
lodged at the king's expense, and the cathedral where the dauphin was
crowned, still exist in Rheims.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img049.jpg" width="400" height="603" alt="" title="">
<p>Joan of Arc.</p></div>

<p>During all Joan's life as a soldier and general, she exhibited a most
touching humanity toward the conquered enemy. She would spring from
her horse to sooth the wounds of a suffering English soldier, and it
is recorded of her that she carried a dying enemy in her arms to a
confessor, and remained with him till his soul took flight. The people
adored her, the soldiers of her army idolized her, and the king
realized that she was of too great value to him to permit her to go in
peace to her old humble home. So Joan remained, asking that the king
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> would remove all impost from the village of Domremy, in
place of bestowing a title upon her family as he offered to do. For
three hundred years her request was obeyed. From this time to the
tragic end, the story of Joan's life is a hard one to relate. Although
we are nearing the fifth centennial of her birth, the recital of her
sufferings and death must still wring tears from every heart which is
not made of stone. The feeling of jealousy which great success, of
even the most worthy and noble souls, arouses in meaner natures, had
already sprung up against Joan. This feeling increased as the days
passed by and she added more and more to her glory by the conquest of
Laon, Soissons, Compiègne, and Beauvais. Paris was next besieged, and
here Joan was seriously wounded, an event which depressed the king and
the army.</p>

<p>Her wound disabled her from action, and she was left lying on the
field until evening, neglected, and seemingly forgotten. Already
conscious of the growing sentiment of jealousy among her officers,
this final proof of their indifference to her fate must have been more
painful to her pure and lofty mind than the physical agony she was
enduring. But even lying there, wounded, she cheered on the men as
they passed her in the combat, and revived their failing courage.</p>

<p>She was enabled to resume action the next day; her plans were all
perfected, and judging from her past triumphs we can but suppose
victory would have attended her, had not that most remarkable mandate
arrived from the king, commanding the French army to retreat to
Saint-Denis.</p>

<p>To the undying shame of his memory be it said that Charles VII.
entered into a plot, with jealous enemies of Joan, to force failure
upon her. The people and the soldiers had grown to believe her
infallible; the king and his favorites determined that she should be
proven fallible. They deemed the country sufficiently safe, the army
sufficiently strong, to enable them to go on now and claim victories
of their own, without having their divine deliverer share the glory.</p>

<p>Next to the crime of Isabel, who sold her son and her country to the
enemy, this base act of Charles VII. stands unparalleled in infamy. So
discouraged and heart-broken was Joan over the conduct of the king,
although she did not understand the deep-laid plot against her, that
she resolved to abandon the life of a soldier and enter the church of
Saint-Denis. She hung up her armor and her sword, but when the king
heard of this he sent for her to return to the army. He was not yet
sure of himself, and he wanted her where he could call upon her if
need be.</p>

<p>Joan returned with reluctance; "her Voices" counselled her to keep to
her resolution; but she was so accustomed to obey the king, that for
the first time she allowed an earthly voice to overrule the counsels
of her heavenly guides. And from this hour her star set; from this
hour her path led into darkness. Soon after her return to the army she
broke the magic sword with which she had achieved so many conquests;
the Voices, too, were silent, and all this troubled her. The king kept
her away from all active warfare, and she grew restive and impatient
with her life of inaction. The army, which under her influence had
been reformed of half its vices, now separated from her by the king's
orders and fell <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> into the most wild excesses. Joan prayed and
pleaded to be allowed to go again into combat, and finally the king
allowed her to do so; but such success attended her, and such
enthusiasm seized upon her soldiers, that the jealous favorites of the
king were alarmed. They resolved to prevent any further triumphs for
her, but to pretend great friendship and admiration meanwhile.</p>

<p>The king was influenced to bestow honors and titles upon her family,
and to present her two brothers, who had fought in the army, with
swords of silver; all of which Joan received coldly and with
indifference, for meantime she was suffering such agony as only so
brave and valiant a soul could suffer in being kept from her duty.</p>

<p>After four months of this galling life, Joan could not fail to see
that she was the victim of a jealous plot. What suffering to a nature
so honest and self-sacrificing as hers, to discover that the king for
whom she had achieved such miracles, was a coward and a hypocrite,
unworthy of her respect and faith.</p>

<p>But it was surely this knowledge which actuated Joan to take a few
brave men, and without orders from the king, to go in aid of William
de Flavy, commander of the fortress of Compiègne, who was in distress.
She set out, and on the evening of May 24th, headed an attack upon the
English. She fought nobly and well, but before the close of the
combat, she was obliged to sound a retreat, and as she was attempting
to escape through the half-closed city gate, an English archer came up
behind and pulled her to the ground.</p>

<p>Joan of Arc was a prisoner. The joy of the English was
overwhelming&mdash;the despair of the French correspondingly great; and
that despair gave place to anger when it was learned that William de
Flavy, the man whom she had tried to defend, had betrayed her into the
hands of the English because he was jealous of her. This man's wife
slew him when she learned of his base act, and was pardoned for the
crime when she told its cause. In all the cities which Joan had
delivered from English control, public prayers and processions were
ordered; people walked barefooted and bareheaded, chanting the
<i>Miserere</i>, in the streets of Tours. She was imprisoned first at
Beaurevoir, then in the prison of Arras, and from there she was taken
to Le Crotoy.</p>

<p>It was customary in those days to exchange prisoners taken in arms, or
to ransom them; but the English had suffered such loss and defeat
through Joan that they determined she should die.</p>

<p>Their only way to do this without publicly dishonoring themselves, was
to accuse her of being a witch, and to compel the "religious" tribunal
of her own land to become her murderer.</p>

<p>During the first six months of her captivity Joan was treated
humanely; but the defeat of the English at Compiègne awoke anew the
superstitions of the English, who believed that, though a prisoner,
she exercised her spell upon the army; and she was taken to Le Crotoy,
and cast into an iron cage with chains upon her wrists and ankles.
After being starved, insulted, and treated with the most hellish
brutality in prison for nearly ten months, the saviour of France was
brought before a tribunal of men, all of them her enemies. There were
three days of this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span> shameful pretence of a trial, and the
holy maid, deserted by those whom she had crowned with glory and
benefits, was trapped into signing a paper which she supposed only a
form of abjuration, but which proved to be a confession of all the
crimes with which she was charged; and after she was returned to her
dungeon this was exhibited to the people to convince them of her guilt
and turn the tide of public sympathy. The Bishop of Beauvais then
sentenced her to prison for the rest of her life, on condition that
she resume woman's apparel; yet one morning she woke to find no dress
in her prison but the clothes she had worn in battle. No sooner had
she donned these than the bishop appeared, and accused her of
disobedience to the orders of the Church, and he fixed her execution
for the next day.</p>

<p>When the horrible fact was made known to her that she was to be burned
at the stake in the market-place of Rouen, before a multitude of
people, she burst into piercing cries of agony. Her physical strength,
courage, and brain-power were all impaired by the months of abuse she
had endured, and her very soul was torn by the neglect and
indifference which the base king manifested toward her. Up to the very
last hour she had believed deliverance would come, but it came only
through death. Never since that spectacle of the bleeding Nazarene
upon the Cross of Calvary, has the world beheld so terrible a picture
of crucified innocence and purity as that of Joan of Arc, the saviour
of France, burning in the market-place of Rouen. With her dying breath
she cried out that the Voices were real, and that she had obeyed God
in listening to their counsels.</p>

<p>Her last word was the name of&mdash;Jesus.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>Hans Gensfleisch Gutenberg von Sorgeloch was a young patrician&mdash;born
at Mainz, a free and wealthy city on the banks of the Rhine, in the
year 1400. His father, Friel Gensfleisch, married Else von Gutenberg,
who gave her name to her second son John.</p>

<p>It is probable that if Mainz, his country, had not been a free city,
this young gentleman would have been unable to conceive or to carry
into execution his invention. Despotism and superstition equally
insist upon silence; they would have stifled the universal and
resistless echo which genius <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> was about to create for written
words. Printing and liberty were both to spring from the same soil and
the same climate.</p>

<p>Mainz, Strasburg, Worms, and other municipal towns on the Rhine, then
governed themselves, under the suzerainty of the empire, as small
federal republics, like Florence, Genoa, Venice, and the other states
of Italy. The nobility warlike, the burgesses increasing in
importance, and the laboring population vacillating between these two
classes, who alternately oppressed and courted it, from time to time,
here as everywhere, fought for supremacy. Outbursts of civil war,
excited by vanity or interest, and in which the victory remained
sometimes with the patricians, sometimes with the burgesses, and at
others with the artisans, made them alternately victors, conquered,
and proscribed. This is the history of all cities, of all republics,
and of all empires. Mainz, was a miniature of Rome or Athens, only the
proscribed party had not the sea to cross to escape from their
country; they went outside the walls, and crossed the Rhine; those of
Strasburg going to Mainz, and those of Mainz to Strasburg, to wait
until their party recovered power, or until they were recalled by
their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>In these intestine struggles of Mainz, the young Gutenberg, himself a
gentleman, and naturally fighting for the cause most holy in a son's
eyes&mdash;that of his father&mdash;was defeated by the burgesses, and banished,
with all the knights of his family, from the territory of Mainz. His
mother and sisters alone remained there in possession of their
property, as innocent victims on whom the faults of the nobility
should not be visited. His first banishment was short, and peace was
ratified by the return of the refugees. A vain quarrel about
precedence in the public ceremonies on the occasion of the solemn
entry of the Emperor Robert, accompanied by the Archbishop Conrad,
into Mainz, refreshed the animosity of the two classes in 1420, and
young Gutenberg, at the age of nineteen, under went his second exile.</p>

<p>The free city of Frankfort now offered itself as a mediator between
the nobles and plebeians of Mainz, and procured their recall on
condition of the governing magistracy being equally shared between the
high classes and the burgesses. But Gutenberg, whether his valor in
the civil war had rendered him more obnoxious and more hostile to the
burgesses; whether his pride, fostered by the traditions of his race,
could not submit patiently to an equality with plebeians; or whether,
more probably, ten years of exile and study at Strasburg had already
turned the bent of his thoughts to a nobler subject than the vain
honors of a free city, refused <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> to return to his country. His
mother, who watched over her son's interest at Mainz, petitioned the
republic to allow him to receive as a pension a small portion of the
revenues of his confiscated possessions. The republic replied that the
young patrician's refusal to return to his country was a declaration
of war, and that the republic did not pay its enemies. Gutenberg,
persisting in his voluntary exile and in his disdain, lived on the
secret remittances of his mother.</p>

<p>But at Strasburg he already enjoyed so great a popularity for his
disposition and his acquirements, that one day, when the chief
magistrate of Mainz was passing the territory of Strasburg, he was
arrested by the friends of Gutenberg, shut up in a castle, and did not
recover his liberty until the city of Mainz had signed a treaty which
restored the exile his patrimony. Thus this youth, the great tribune
of the human mind, whose invention was destined to destroy forever the
prejudices of race, and to restore, in after-times, liberty and civil
equality to all the plebeians of the world, began his life, as yet
unrecognized, at the head of the patrician party of his country, in
these struggles between the privileged castes and the people. Fortune
seemed to delight in the contrast. But Gutenberg's wisdom, increasing
with his age, was afterward destined to reunite the people and
nobility, who looked on each other as enemies.</p>

<p>The restoration of his goods allowed young Gutenberg to satisfy his
literary, religious, and artistic tastes, by travelling from town to
town to study monuments, and visit men of all conditions celebrated
for their science, their art, or even their trade. The artisans of
Germany then held nearly the same rank as the artists. It was at the
time when the trades, scarcely known, were confused with the arts, and
when the most humble professions produced their earliest masterpieces,
which, on account of their novelty, were looked upon as prodigies.
Gutenberg travelled alone, on foot, carrying a knapsack containing
books and clothes, like a mere student visiting the schools, or a
journeyman looking for a master. He thus went through the Rhenish
provinces, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and lastly, Holland, not
without an object, like a man who lets his imagination wander at the
caprice of his footsteps, but carrying everywhere with him a fixed
idea, an unchanging will led by a presentiment. This guiding star was
the thought of spreading the word of God and the Bible among a vaster
number of souls.</p>

<p>Thus it was religion which, in this young wandering apostle, was
seeking the soil wherein to sow a single seed, of which the fruit
hereafter was to be a thousand various grains. It is the glory of
printing that it was given to the world by religion, not by industry.
Religious enthusiasm was alone worthy to give birth to the instrument
of truth.</p>

<p>What mechanical processes Gutenberg may until then have revolved in
his mind, remains unknown. Whatever they were, chance effaced them
all, and brought him at once upon his great discovery. One day, at
Haarlem, in Holland, the verger of the cathedral, named Lawrence
Koster, with whom he had established friendly relations, showed him in
the sacristy a Latin grammar, curiously wrought in engraved letters on
a wooden board, for the instruction of the seminarists. Chance, that
gratuitous teacher, had produced this approach to printing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> The poor and youthful sacristan of Haarlem was in love. He
used to walk on holydays to the spring outside the town, and sit under
the willows by the canals, to indulge in his day-dreams. His heart
full of the image of his bride, he used to amuse himself, in true
lover's fashion, by engraving with his knife the initials of his
mistress and himself, interlaced, as an emblem of the union of their
hearts and of their interwoven destinies. But, instead of cutting
these ciphers on the bark, and leaving them to grow with the tree,
like the mysterious ciphers so often seen on the trees in the forests
and by the brooks, he engraved them on little blocks of willow
stripped of their bark, and still reeking with the moisture of their
sap; and he used to carry them, as a remembrance of his dreams and a
pledge of affection, to his lady-love.</p>

<p>One day, having thus cut some letters on the green wood, probably with
more care and perfection than usual, he wrapped up his little work in
a piece of parchment, and brought it with him to Haarlem. On opening
it next day to look at his letters, he was astonished to see the
cipher perfectly reproduced in brown on the parchment by the relieved
portion of the letters, the sap having oozed out during the night and
imprinted its image on the envelope. This was a discovery. He engraved
other letters on a large platter, replaced the sap by a black liquid,
and thus obtained the first proof ever printed. But it would only
print a single page. The movable variety and endless combinations of
characters infinitely multiplied, to meet the vast requirements of
literature, were wanting. The invention of the poor sacristan would
have covered the surface of the earth with plates engraved or
sculptured in relief, but would not have been a substitute for a
single case of movable type. Nevertheless, the principle of the art
was developed in the sacristy of Haarlem, and we might hesitate
whether to attribute the honor of it to Koster or Gutenberg, if its
invention had not been with one the mere accidental discovery of love
and chance, and, in the other, the well-earned victory of patience and
genius.</p>

<p>At the sight of this coarse plank, the lightning from heaven flashed
before the eyes of Gutenberg. He looked at the plank, and, in his
imagination, analyzed it, decomposed it, put it together again,
changed it, divided it, readjusted it, reversed it, smeared it with
ink, placed the parchment on it, and pressed it with a screw. The
sacristan, wondering at his long silence, was unwittingly present at
this development of an idea over which his visitor had brooded in vain
for the last ten years. When Gutenberg retired, he carried a new art
with him.</p>

<p>On the morrow, like a man who possesses a treasure, and knows neither
rest nor sleep until he has hidden it safely, Gutenberg left Haarlem,
hastened up the Rhine until he reached Strasburg, shut himself up in
his work-room, fashioned his own tools, tried, broke, planned,
rejected, returned to his plans, and again rejected them, only to
return to them again; and ended by secretly executing a fortunate
proof upon parchment with movable wooden types, bored through the side
with a small hole, strung together and kept close by a thread, like
square beads on a chaplet, each with a letter of the alphabet cut in
relief on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> one side&mdash;the first printer's alphabet, coarse,
but wonderful&mdash;the first company of twenty-four letters, which
multiplied like the herds of the patriarchs, until at last they
covered the whole earth with written characters, in which a new and
immaterial element&mdash;human thought&mdash;became incarnate.</p>

<p>Gutenberg, perceiving at the first glance the immense social and
industrial bearing of his invention, felt that his weak hand, short
life, and moderate property would be spent in vain on such a work. He
experienced two opposite wants&mdash;the necessity of associating with
himself persons to assist in meeting the expenses and in executing the
mechanical labor, and the necessity of concealing from his assistants
the secret and real object of their labors, for fear lest his
invention might be divulged and pirated, and the glory and merit of
his discovery taken from him. He cast his eyes on the nobility and
rich gentry of his acquaintance at Strasburg and Mainz. He probably
met with rebuffs from all quarters, on account of the prejudice then
prevailing that handicrafts were derogatory to a gentleman. He was,
therefore, obliged to sink his rank, become a workman, associate with
artisans, and mix with the people, in order to raise the people to the
high level of morality and intelligence.</p>

<p>Under the pretence of working together at <i>a new and marvellous
craft</i>, such as jewelry, clock-making, and grinding and setting
precious stones, he entered into a deed of partnership with two
wealthy inhabitants of Strasburg, Andrew Dritzchen and Hans Riffe,
bailiff of Lichtenau; and afterward with Faust, a goldsmith and banker
of Mainz, whose name, confounded with that of Faustus, the wondrous
sorcerer of German fable, the master of mystery, and the friend of the
Evil One, caused the invention of printing to be attributed to magic;
and, lastly, with Hulmann, whose brother had just established the
first paper-mill at Strasburg.</p>

<p>In order the more effectually to conceal from his partners the real
object of his pursuit, Gutenberg joined them in several artistic and
secondary enterprises. Continuing in secret his mechanical researches
on printing, he employed himself publicly in these other occupations.
He taught Dritzchen the art of cutting precious stones. He himself
polished Venetian glass for mirrors, or cut pieces of it into facets,
setting them in copper frames ornamented with wooden figurines
representing personages from history or fable, from the Bible or the
Testament. These articles, which found sale at the fair of
Aix-la-Chapelle, kept up the funds of the association, and assisted
Gutenberg in the secret expenses reserved for accomplishing and
perfecting his design.</p>

<p>To conceal it the better also from the restless curiosity of the
public, who began to circulate a suspicion of witchcraft against him,
Gutenberg left the town, and established his workshop in the ruins of
an old deserted monastery, called the Convent of St. Arbogast. The
solitude of the place, only inhabited by the houseless poor of the
suburbs, covered his first attempts.</p>

<p>In a corner of one of the vast cloisters of the monastery, occupied by
his partners for their less secret labors, Gutenberg had reserved for
himself a cell, always closed with lock and bolt, and to which none
but himself ever had access. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> He was supposed to go there to
draw the designs, arabesques, and figurines for his jewelry and the
frames of his glasses; but he passed his days and sleepless nights
there, wearing himself out in the pursuit of his invention. There it
was that he engraved his movable types in wood, and projected casting
them in metal, and studied hard to find the means of inclosing them in
<i>forms</i>, whether of wood or of iron, to make the types into words,
phrases, and lines, and to leave spaces on the paper. There it was
that he invented colored mediums, oleaginous and yet drying, to
reproduce these characters, brushes and dabbers to spread the ink on
the letters, boards to hold them, and screws and weights to compress
them. Months and years were spent, as well as his own fortune and the
funds of the firm, in these persevering experiments, with alternate
success and disappointment.</p>

<p>At length, having made a model of a press, which seemed to him to
combine all the requirements of printing, according to his ideas at
that time, he concealed it under his cloak, and walking to the town,
went to a skilful turner in wood and metal, named Conrad Saspach, who
lived in the Mercer's Lane, asking him to make the machine of full
size. He requested the workman to keep it secret, merely telling him
that it was a machine by the help of which he proposed to produce some
masterpieces of art and mechanism, of which the marvels should be
known in due time.</p>

<p>The turner, taking the model in his hands, and turning it backward and
forward with the smile of contempt that a skilful artist usually puts
on when looking at a rough specimen, said, somewhat scornfully, "But
it is just simply a press that you are asking me for, Master Hans!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Gutenberg, with a grave and enthusiastic tone, "it is a
press, certainly, but a press from which shall soon flow in
inexhaustible streams the most abundant and most marvellous liquor
that has ever flowed to relieve the thirst of man! Through it God will
spread his Word. A spring of pure truth shall flow from it; like a new
star, it shall scatter the darkness of ignorance, and cause a light
heretofore unknown to shine among men." He retired. The turner, who
understood not these words, made the machine, and delivered it at the
monastery of Arbogast.</p>

<p>This was the first printing-press.</p>

<p>As soon as he was in possession of his press, Gutenberg began
printing. Little is known of the first works which he sent out; but
the strongly religious disposition of the inventor leaves no doubt
concerning the nature of the labors to which he devoted the
first-fruits of his art. They were, to a certainty, religious books.
The art invented for the sake of God, and by his inspiration, began
with his worship. His later publications at Mainz are a proof of it;
the divine songs of the Psalmist, and the celebrated Latin Bible, were
the first works issued at Mainz from the machine invented by
Gutenberg, and applied to the use of the most sacred powers of man,
lyrical praise of his Maker, and lamentation for the woes of earth.
Under the hands of this pious and unfortunate man, praise and prayer
were the first voices of the press. The press ought ever to be proud
of it.</p>

<a id="img051" name="img051"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img051.jpg" width="600" height="453" alt="" title="">
<p>Gutenberg's Invention.</p></div>

<p>But great tribulation awaited him after his triumph. We have seen that
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> necessity of procuring funds obliged him to take
partners. The necessity that subsequently arose of getting assistance
for the multifarious labor of a great printing establishment obliged
him to confide his occupation, and even the secret of his process, to
his partners and to a number of workmen. His partners, tired of
supplying funds to an enterprise which, for want of perfection, was
not then remunerative, refused to persevere in the ungrateful
occupation. Gutenberg begged them not to abandon him at the very
moment that fortune and glory were within his grasp. They consented to
make fresh advances, but only on condition of sharing completely his
secret, his profits, his property, and his fame.</p>

<p>He sold his fame to procure success to his work. The name of Gutenberg
disappeared. The firm absorbed the inventor, who soon became a mere
workman in his own workshop. It was a parallel to the case of
Christopher Columbus brought back in irons on board his own vessel, by
a crew to whom he had opened a new world.</p>

<p>This was not all. The heirs of one of the partners brought an action
against him to contest his invention, his property, and his right of
carrying on the work. They compelled him to appear before the judges
at Strasburg, to make him submit to some more complete and more legal
spoliation than the voluntary abandonment he had himself acknowledged.
His perplexity before the court was extreme. To justify himself, it
was necessary to enter into all the technical details of his art,
which he did not as yet wish to make completely public, reserving to
himself, at least, the secret of his hopes. The judges, being
inquisitive, pressed him with insidious questions, the answers to
which would have exposed the secret of all his processes. He evaded
them, preferring an adverse decision to the publication of his art. To
succeed in penetrating the secret of the discovery which filled
people's imaginations, the judges summoned his most confidential
workmen, and required them to give evidence of what they knew. These
men, simple-minded, yet faithful and strongly attached to Gutenberg,
refused to reveal anything. Their master's secret was safer in their
hearts than in the breasts of his more grasping associates. None of
the great mysteries of the art transpired. Gutenberg, ruined,
condemned, perhaps banished, retired alone and in poverty to Mainz,
his native place, to recommence his labors and begin his life and fame
anew.</p>

<p>He was still young, and the report of his lawsuit at Strasburg had
made his fame known all over Germany, but he returned a workman to a
city which he had quitted as a knight. Humiliation, poverty, and glory
contended with each other in his fate and in the behavior of his
fellow-citizens. Love alone recognized him for what he had been, and
for what he was one day to become.</p>

<p>On his return to Mainz, having been relieved from degradation and ruin
by the woman he loved, as Mohammed was by his first wife, Gutenberg
gave himself entirely up to his art, entered into partnership with
Faust and Sch&oelig;ffer, Faust's son-in-law; established offices at
Mainz, and published, still under the name of the firm, Bibles and
Psalters, of remarkable perfection of type.</p>

<p>Sch&oelig;ffer had for a long time carried on the business of a
scrivener, and a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> trade in manuscripts in Paris. His travels,
and his intimacy with the artists of that town, had made him
acquainted with mechanical processes for working in metals, which he
adapted, on his return to Mainz, to the art of printing. These new
means enabled him to cast movable leaden types in a copper matrix,
with greater precision than before, and thus to give great neatness to
the letters. It was by this new process that the Psalter, the first
book bearing a date, was printed in 1457. Soon afterward the Mainz
Bible, recognized as a masterpiece of art, was produced under the
direction of Gutenberg, from types founded by Peter Sch&oelig;ffer's
process.</p>

<p>The tendency of the new art, which began by cheapening sacred books
under the auspices of the Church alone, escaped, during the first
years of its existence, the notice of the Roman court, which saw an
auxiliary in what it afterward considered as an opponent.</p>

<p>"Among the number of blessings which we ought to praise God for having
vouchsafed during your pontificate," says a dedication in the time of
Paul II., "is this invention, which enables the poorest to procure
libraries at a low price. Is it not a great glory to your Holiness,
that volumes which used to cost <i>one hundred pieces of gold</i> are now
to be bought for four, or even less, and that the fruits of genius,
heretofore the prey of the worms and buried in dust, begin under your
reign to arise from the dead, and to multiply profusely over all the
earth?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Faust the banker, and Sch&oelig;ffer the workman, Gutenberg's
new partners, were not long in giving way, like his former partner,
one Mentel or Metelin at Strasburg, to the temptation of absorbing by
degrees Gutenberg's glory, the most tempting of all possessions,
because of its immortality. Like many others, they hoped to deceive
posterity, if not their own contemporaries. After recognizing, in the
Epistle Dedicatory prefixed to the German translation of Livy, printed
by Hans Sch&oelig;ffer, and addressed to the Emperor Maximilian, "that
the art of printing was invented at Mainz by that sublime mechanician
Hans von Gutenberg," they forgot this confession, and seven years
later assumed to themselves all the merit and honor of the discovery.</p>

<p>A short time afterward, the Emperor Maximilian, erecting the printers
and compositors into a species of intellectual priesthood, relieved
them by the nobility of their occupation from all degradation of rank.
He ennobled the art and the artists together; he authorized them to
wear robes embroidered with gold and silver, which nobles only had a
right to wear, and gave them for armorial bearings an eagle with his
wings spread over a globe, a symbol of the flight of written thoughts,
and of its conquest of the world.</p>

<p>But Gutenberg was no longer upon earth to enjoy the possession of that
intellectual world, religious and political, of which he had only had
a glimpse, like Moses, in the vision of his dream in the monastery of
St. Arbogast. Despoiled by his partners of his property and of his
fame; expelled again, and for the last time, from his country by
poverty, his only consolation being that he was followed by his wife,
who remained faithful through all his troubles; deprived by death of
all his children; advanced in years, without bread, and soon
afterward, by his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> wife's decease, a widower, he was received
by the Elector of Nassau, the generous Adolphus. The elector created
him his counsellor of state and chamberlain, in order to enjoy in an
honorable familiarity the conversation of this surpassing genius, who
was afterward to hold converse with all times and all places. This
shelter afforded to Gutenberg sheds everlasting lustre on Nassau and
its prince. We meet in history with instances where a generous
hospitality has given happiness and immortal fame to the most
insignificant potentates and to the smallest of states.</p>

<p>Gutenberg continued printing with his own hands, at Nassau, under the
eyes of his Mæcenas, the elector, during several years of peace and
quiet. He died at the age of sixty-eight, leaving his sister no
inheritance, but bequeathing to the world the empire of the human
mind, discovered and achieved by a workman.</p>

<p>"I bequeath," he says in his will, "to my sister all the books which I
printed at the monastery of St. Arbogast." The poor inventor's only
legacy to his surviving relative was the common property of almost all
inventors like himself&mdash;wasted youth, a persecuted life, a name
aspersed, toil, watchings, and the oblivion of his contemporaries.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>WILLIAM CAXTON<br>

(1412-1491)</h3>


<a id="img052" name="img052"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img052.jpg" width="250" height="350" alt="William Caxton." title="">
</div>

<p>William Caxton, to whom England owes the introduction of printing, was
born, according to his own statement, in the Weald of Kent. Of the
date of his birth nothing is known with certainty, though Oldys places
it in 1412. Lewis and Oldys suppose that between his fifteenth and
eighteenth years he was put apprentice to one Robert Large, a mercer
or merchant of considerable eminence, who was afterward, successively,
sheriff and lord mayor of London, and who upon his death, in 1441,
remembered Caxton in his will by a legacy of 20 marks. Caxton at this
time had become a freeman of the Company of Mercers. His knowledge of
business, however, induced him, either upon his own account or as
agent of some merchant, to travel to the Low Countries for a short
time. In 1464 we find him joined in a commission with one Robert
Whitehill, to continue and confirm a treaty of trade and commerce
between Edward IV. and Philip, Duke of Burgundy; or if they find it
necessary, to make a new one. They are styled in it ambassadors
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> and special deputies. This commission at least affords a
proof that Caxton had acquired a reputation for knowledge of business.
Seven years afterward Caxton describes himself as leading a life of
ease, when, "having no great charge or occupation," he set about
finishing the translation of Raoul le Fevre's "Recueil des Histoires
de Troye," which he had commenced two years before, in 1469. The
original was the first book he printed, and this translation the
third. Of Caxton's pursuits and travels abroad, we know little more
than that in his peregrinations he confined himself, for the most
part, to the countries of Brabant, Flanders, Holland, and Zealand, and
finally entered into the service, or at least the household, of
Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, who encouraged him to finish his
translation of Le Fevre's "History of Troy," assisted him with her
criticisms upon his English, and amply rewarded him upon the
completion of his labor. From the prologues and epilogues of this work
we discover that he was now somewhat advanced in years, and that he
had learnt to exercise the art of printing, but by what step he had
acquired this knowledge cannot be discovered; his types only show that
he acquired it in the Low Countries. He does not appear to have seen
any of the beautiful productions of the Roman, Venetian, and Parisian
presses before he had caused his own font of letters to be cut.</p>

<p>The original of Raoul's "History," the "Oration of John Russell on
Charles, Duke of Burgundy, being created a Knight of the Garter," and
the "Translation" of Raoul, were, as far as we know, Caxton's first
three works; the last finished in 1471. A "Stanza," by Wynkyn de
Worde, notices an edition of "Bartholom&oelig;us, de Proprietatibus
Rerum," as printed by Caxton at Cologne (about 1470), but the actual
existence of this edition is unknown. Nor has more certain information
yet been obtained of the exact period of Caxton's return to his native
country. The usual supposition has been that he brought the art of
printing into England in 1474, and this date is indicated by the
figures which are united in the centre of his device as a printer. In
1477, however, he had undoubtedly quitted the Low Countries and taken
up his residence in the vicinity of Westminster Abbey, where and in
which year he printed his "Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers."
Stowe says he first exercised his business in an old chapel near the
entrance of the abbey; but a very curious placard, a copy of which, in
Caxton's largest type, is now at Oxford in the late Mr. Douce's
library, shows that he printed in the Almonry. It is as follows: "If
it plese any man spirituel or temporel to bye ony Pyes of two and thre
comemoracions of Salisburi vse emprynted, after the forme of this
present lettre whiche ben wel and truly correct, late hym come to
Westmonester in to the Almonesrye at the reed pole and he shal have
them good chepe. Supplico stet cedula." According to Bagford, Caxton's
office was afterward removed to King Street.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img053.jpg" width="600" height="467" alt="" title="">
<p>The First Sheet from Caxton's Press.</p></div>

<p>From the evidence of Wynkyn de Worde, in the colophon of his edition
of "Vitæ Patrum," 1495, it appears that these "Lives of the Fathers"
were "translated out of French into English by William Caxton, of
Westminster, lately dead," and that he finished the work "at the last
day of his life." His death, however, seems fixed, by two or three
entries in the parish accounts of St. Margaret, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span>
Westminster, to the year 1491 or 1492, in which we read, "Item: atte
bureyng of William Caxton for iiij, torches vj<sup>s</sup> viij<sup>d</sup>. Item: for the
belle at same Bureyng vj<sup>d</sup>." Wynkyn de Worde no doubt referred to this
time.</p>

<p>Caxton, Mr. Warton observes, by translating, or procuring to be
translated, a great number of books from the French, greatly
contributed to promote the state of literature in England. In regard
to his types, Mr. Dibdin says he appears to have made use of five
distinct sets, or fonts, of letters, which, in his account of Caxton's
works, he has engraved plates in fac-simile. Edward Rowe Mores, in his
"Dissertation upon English Typographical Founders and Foundries," says
Caxton's letter was originally of the sort called Secretary, and of
this he had two fonts; afterward he came nearer to the English face,
and had three fonts of Great Primer, a rude one which he used anno
1474, another something better, and a third cut about 1482; one of
Double Pica, good, which first appears 1490; and one of Long Primer,
at least nearly agreeing with the bodies which have since been called

<p>The discovery and the discoverer of America have furnished an almost
inexhaustible theme for the critic, the biographer, and the historian.
In the year 1892 there was celebrated an event which has come by
common consent to be regarded as a world-famous epoch, worthy to be
held in everlasting remembrance. We commemorated the man whose
discovery almost doubled the extent of the habitable globe.</p>

<p>The life, the voyages, the brilliant triumphs, and the mournful end of
Columbus are already familiar to most readers. To recount them at
length would be here a needless repetition. Let us rather attempt to
glance at some of the historic disputes involving the character and
acts of the great discoverer, to sketch briefly the sources of
information about him, and to characterize some of the more important
writings upon the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> There is no lack of biographical material concerning the
discoverer of America. He has left memorials of his personality and
life-history more abundant than most of the men who have influenced
their age. There are more than sixty authentic letters of Columbus in
existence. There are long narratives of his expeditions and
discoveries, by persons who knew him more or less intimately. There is
an extended biography of him written by his own son, Ferdinand
Columbus, or from materials furnished by him. There are numerous
documents and state papers authenticating his acts, his privileges,
and his dignities. And yet, with all the wealth of material, so
copious upon his character and his career, it would seem, from recent
developments, that the true discoverer of America is yet to be
discovered.</p>

<p>Among the many lives of Columbus that have been written, there exist
some twenty-five in the English language. Of these two or three only
have any historical or critical value. The mass of biographies, both
English and American, are mere echoes or abridgments, in other forms
of language, of the great work of Washington Irving, first published
in 1828. This book was written in Spain, and based upon collections of
documents (manuscript and printed) not previously used by biographers.
Hence its value as the most copious and systematic life of Columbus
which had appeared in any language. The finished and graceful style
which characterizes all the works of its accomplished author gave it a
high place in literature, which it has maintained for more than half a
century, being constantly reprinted.</p>

<p>Next in point of time to Irving, though treating Columbus with less
fulness of detail, came the polished historian Prescott, whose
"History of Ferdinand and Isabella" was published in 1837. This ardent
and laborious scholar was, like Irving, constitutionally inclined to
the optimistic view of his leading characters. To magnify the virtues
and to minimize the faults of their heroes has always been the
besetting sin of biographers. The pomp and picturesque circumstance of
the Spanish court, the splendid administrative abilities of Ferdinand,
the beauty, amiability, and devoted piety of Isabella, are depicted in
glowing colors, but the crimes and cruelties which they sanctioned,
while condemned upon one page, are softly extenuated upon others.
Columbus appears as a romantic figure in history, the glory of whose
successful discovery atones for his many failings.</p>

<p>Of the original sources of information about Columbus the most
important are:</p>

<p>1. The great collection of original documents printed in Spanish by
Navarrete, in 1825-37, in five volumes, and partly reprinted in a
French translation in 1828. These contain the precious letters of
Columbus, many of which have been translated and recently published in
English.</p>

<p>2. The "Historia general de las Indias," of Oviedo, first published in
1535.</p>

<p>3. The "Historia de las Indias," of the Spanish Bishop Las Casas,
composed in 1527 to 1561, which remained in manuscript until 1875,
when it was printed from the original Spanish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span> 4. The "Letters and the Decades of Peter Martyr," written in
part contemporaneously with the discovery of America, and printed in
Latin in 1530, and in English in 1555.</p>

<p>5. The "Historia de las Reyes Catolicos," of Andres Bernaldez.</p>

<p>6. The "Life of the Discoverer," by Ferdinand Columbus, first
published in 1571 at Venice, in Italian.</p>

<p>The last five writers had personal knowledge or intercourse with
Columbus, while Las Casas, Oviedo, and Ferdinand had the advantage of
residence in America, and intimate knowledge of the aborigines, and of
the men and events of the period.</p>

<p>Almost every item involved in the checkered and eventful life of
Columbus has afforded a fruitful theme for controversy. His birth,
even, is disputed, under stress of evidence, as falling anywhere
between 1435 and 1447&mdash;a discrepancy of twelve years. His birthplace
is claimed by more towns than that of Homer, although his own
statement, that he was a native of Genoa, has met general concurrence.
His knowledge of geography, astronomy, and navigation is asserted and
denied with various degrees of pertinacity. His treatment by the
sovereigns of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon is so far in question that
irreconcilable differences of opinion exist. How much Columbus really
owed to the aid of the crown, and how much to private enterprise, in
fitting out his expeditions of discovery, cannot be definitely
ascertained. How far he was hindered by the bigotry, or helped by the
enlightenment of powerful ecclesiastics, as at the council of
Salamanca, is a theme of perennial controversy.</p>

<p>The island where he first landed is so far from being identified, that
many books have been written to prove the claims of this, that, or the
other gem of the sea to be the true land-fall of Columbus. His
treatment of the natives has been made the subject of unsparing
denunciation and of undiscriminating eulogy. His conduct toward his
own, often mutinous, crews is alternately lauded as humane and
generous, or denounced as arrogant and cruel, according to the
sympathies or the point of view of the critic. His imprisonment and
attempted disgrace have been made the theme of indignant comment and
of extenuating apology. His moral character and marital relations are
subjects of irreconcilable differences of judgment. His deep religious
bias, so manifest in nearly all his writings, has been praised as a
mark of exalted merit by some writers, and stigmatized by others as
cant and superstition. The last resting-place of his bones, even, is
in doubt, which it required an elaborate investigation by the Royal
Academy of History of Madrid to solve in favor of Havana, as against
the cathedral of Santo Domingo; though its report is still
controverted, and M. A. Pinart has proved to the satisfaction of many
that a misprision took place and that the true remains of Columbus
still rest at Santo Domingo. The movement to canonize the great
discoverer has been championed with more zeal than discretion by some
over-ardent churchmen, while the too-evident human frailties of the
proposed candidate for the honors of sainthood have inspired an
abundant caution in the councils of the Vatican.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span> On a subject fraught with so much inherent difficulty,
contradictory evidence, and conflict of opinion, he is on the safest
ground who candidly holds his judgment in reserve. In the light of the
keenly-sifted evidence which modern critical study has brought to
bear, the laudatory judgments of Irving and Prescott, rendered sixty
years ago, cannot stand wholly approved.</p>

<p>Neither can a discerning reader accept the fulsome laudations of his
principal French biographer, Roselly de Lorgues, whose rhetorical
panegyrics and pious eulogies place its author in the front rank of
the canonizers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those who have taken the unfavorable view of
Columbus, have done their utmost to divest him of most of the honors
which the general voice of history has assigned him as America's
greatest discoverer. The established fact that parts of North America
were seen centuries before, though no permanent settlement nor
continuity of intercourse ensued, has been used to discredit him,
though he was undeniably the pioneer who set out with a plan to
discover, and did discover by design, what others found only by
accident. His geographical ideas were derived, they say, from Behaim
and Toscanelli; his nautical skill from Pinzon; his certainty of
finding new lands from Alonzo Sanchez; his courage and daring from
some of his fellow-voyagers.</p>

<p>We are pointed to his double reckoning on his first voyage, by which
he deceived his sailors as to their true distance from Spain, as
evidence of a false nature. He is charged with ambition, cupidity, and
arrogance, in demanding titles, dignities, and money as fruits of his
discoveries. He was, we are told, a fanatic, a visionary, a tyrant, a
buccaneer, a liar, and a slave-trader. He was proud, cruel, and
vindictive.</p>

<p>What manner of man, then, was this Columbus, with whose name the trump
of fame has been busy so long? As to his person, we have no verified
portrait, while the likenesses (of all periods) claiming to represent
his features, present irreconcilable differences. But here is the
description of him given by Herrera: "Columbus was tall of stature,
long-visaged, of a majestic aspect, his nose hooked, his eyes gray, of
a clear complexion, somewhat ruddy. He was witty and pleasant,
well-spoken and eloquent, moderately grave, affable to strangers, to
his own family mild. His conversation was discreet, which gained him
the affection of those he had to deal with, and his presence attracted
respect, having an air of authority and grandeur. He was a man of
undaunted courage and high thoughts, patient, unmoved in the many
troubles and adversities that attended him, ever relying on the Divine
Providence." Gomara describes him as "a man of good height,
strong-limbed, with a long countenance, fresh and rosy in aspect,
somewhat given to anger, hardy in exposure to fatigues."</p>

<p>Benzoni says that Columbus was "a man of exalted intellect, of a
pleasant and ingenuous countenance."</p>

<p>Bernaldez, the historian of Ferdinand and Isabella, who knew him
intimately in his later years, says "he was a man of very lofty
genius, and of marvellously honored memory."</p>

<img src="images/img055.jpg" width="600" height="418" alt="" title="">
<p>Columbus ridiculed at the Council of Salamanca.</p></div>

<p>With these personal characteristics, Columbus united a restless
spirit, a firm <span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> will, and a singularly enthusiastic
temperament. The latter faculty gave him a consuming zeal for his
undertakings, which was as rare as it proved ultimately successful in
compassing his great discovery. He was discouraged by no rebuffs,
would take no denials. His motto seemed to be never to despair, and
never to let go. His spiritual nature was as remarkable as his
intellectual. Here, his imagination was the predominant faculty. He
firmly believed himself divinely commissioned to find out the Indies,
and to bring their inhabitants into the fold of the true faith. He had
early vowed to devote the profits of his enterprise, if successful, to
rescue the tomb of Christ from the infidels. Himself a devout son of
the Church, he fervently believed that he had miraculous aid on many
perilous occasions of his life. Humble before God, he was sufficiently
proud and independent before men. He insisted upon conditions with the
haughty sovereigns of Spain which they deemed exacting, but the high
views and tenacity of Columbus carried the day, and his own terms were
granted at last. He never forgot, in all his subsequent trials and
humiliations, that he was a Spanish admiral, and Viceroy of the
Indies.</p>

<p>Such was the character of Columbus. Let us now look at his
environment, which in all men contributes so much to make or modify
character. Born in Genoa, the headquarters in that day of navigation,
Columbus early imbibed a passion for maritime affairs. His youthful
days and nights were given to the study of astronomy and of
navigation. He was a trained sailor and map-maker from his boyhood. He
brooded over the problems involved in the spherical form of the earth.
He caught up all the hints and allusions in classical and mediæval
writers that came in his way, of other lands than those already known.
The Atlantis of Plato, and the clear prediction in Seneca of another
world in the west, fired his imagination. He himself tells us that he
voyaged to the Ultima Thule of his day, which was Iceland, besides
various expeditions in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The early fancies of isles in the western sea loomed up before his
eyes, and repeated themselves in his dreams. These visions were
heightened by that vague sense of wonder that is linked with the
unknown. No wonder, then, that Columbus, with a bent almost
preternatural toward the undiscovered regions of the globe, should
dream of new lands, new men, new scenery, and new wealth. But to his
vivid imagination dreams became realities, until he believed with all
the force of his ardent nature that he was divinely commissioned to be
a discoverer. Hitherto the Portuguese voyages familiar to Columbus had
only skirted the coast of Africa, and discovered the Cape Verde
Islands and the Azores. It was not till 1486, years after the idea of
his western voyage took firm root in his mind, that the Cape of Good
Hope was at last doubled by Vasco da Gama. All voyages prior to his
had been only tentative and brief, slowly creeping from headland to
headland, or else finding new islands by being drifted out of courses
long familiar to mariners.</p>

<p>It was the supreme merit of Columbus that he was the first to cut
loose from one continent to find another, and to steer boldly across
an unknown sea, in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span> search of an unknown world. We need not
belittle (still less need we deny) the finding of Greenland and of
other parts of North America by the Norsemen in the ninth and tenth
centuries. We may hail Eric the Red and his stout son, Leif Ericson,
as pioneers in what may be termed coasting voyages of discovery. But
the story of America gains as little from these shadowy and abortive
voyages as civilization has gained from their fruitless results.</p>

<p>On the first voyage of Columbus, he was more fortunate in the
uncertain elements which always affect sea voyages so overpoweringly
than in some of his later ones. His own vessel, with single deck, was
about ninety feet long, by a breadth of twenty feet. The Pinta, a
faster sailer, and the Nina (or "baby") were smaller caravels, and
without decks, commanded respectively by the brothers Martin and
Vicente Pinzon. The three vessels carried ninety persons, sailing
September 6, 1492, running first south to the Canaries, and then
stretching straight westward on the twenty-eighth parallel for what
the admiral believed to be the coast of Japan. Delightful weather
favored the voyagers, but when, on the tenth day out from Spain, the
caravels struck into that wonderful stretch of seaweed and grass,
known as the Sargasso Sea, fear lest they should run aground or soon
be unable to sail in either direction took possession of the crews. In
five days the caravels ran into smooth water again. But as their
distance from Spain grew greater, the spirit of protest and mutiny
grew louder. Columbus needed all of his invincible constancy and
firmness of purpose to quell and to animate his despairing crews. At
last, October 21, 1492&mdash;day ever memorable in the annals of this
world&mdash;the unknown land rose from the bosom of the water. It was named
by its pious discoverer San Salvador&mdash;Holy Saviour. The charm of
climate and of landscape enchanted all, and fear and despondency gave
way to delight and joy and the most extravagant anticipations. The
subsequent history of this first voyage, the wreck of the admiral's
flag-ship Santa Maria, the base desertion of Pinzon, and his baffled
attempt to forestall Columbus in the credit of the discovery, the
triumphal honors paid to the successful admiral, and the pope's bull
conferring upon Spain all lands west of a meridian one hundred leagues
from the Azores&mdash;all this is familiar to most readers. The actual
discoveries of the first voyage included Cuba and Hispaniola (or
Haiti), with some little islands of the Bahama group, of small
importance.</p>

<p>On his second voyage Columbus found no difficulty in collecting
seventeen ships and 1,500 adventurers, so popular had the new way to
the Indies become when the way was once found. He set sail six months
after his return to Spain, or on September 15, 1493. He returned in
June, 1496, after three years of explorations, interrupted by a long
illness, and having discovered Jamaica, Porto Rico, Santa Cruz,
Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, and Guadaloupe.</p>

<p>The third voyage began May 30, 1498, and embraced six vessels and 200
men. Columbus struck southwestward from the Cape Verde Islands and ran
nearly to the equator, into a region of torrid heat, discovering
Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, and the Gulf of Paria, and making his first
landing on the continent, at the Pearl Coast, near the mouth of the
Orinoco, in what is now Venezuela. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span> This voyage witnessed
many disasters&mdash;the rebellion of Roldan, the severe prostration of the
admiral by fever, and his seizure and imprisonment in chains by the
infamous Bobadilla.</p>

<p>The fourth and last voyage of Columbus, with four small caravels and
150 men, was begun May 11, 1502. On this voyage he discovered
Martinique and the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Veragua, on the
mainland, returning to Spain, after untold disasters and miseries, on
November 7, 1504. Then followed the weary struggle of the infirm old
voyager to secure justice and a part of his hard-earned benefits from
the crown. But Isabella had died, and Ferdinand, under the influence
of the hard-hearted and cruel bigot, Fonseca, postponed all the claims
of Columbus. He who had given a world died in poverty, a suppliant for
the means of an honorable existence.</p>

<p>It is easy enough for the writers of the nineteenth century to
criticise the actors of the fifteenth; and learned scholars, sitting
in luxurious easy-chairs in great libraries, can pass swift and severe
judgment upon the acts and motives of Columbus. But let them go back
four hundred years, and divest themselves of the bias which the
science of to-day unconsciously inspires; let them quit the age of
steam-engines, telegraphs, democratic governments, printing-presses,
and Sunday-schools; let them orient themselves, and become Spaniards
of 1492, instead of Americans of 1892; let them take the place of
Columbus&mdash;if they are gifted with imagination enough among their
manifold endowments to do it; let them think his thoughts, endure his
trials, cherish his resolves, encounter his rebuffs, overcome his
obstacles, launch out on his voyage, govern his mutinous crew, deal
with his savage and hostile tribes, combat the traitors in his camp,
suffer his shipwrecks, struggle with his disappointments, bear the
ignominy of his chains, see his visions, and pray his prayers.</p>

<p>Behold him, launched on his uncertain voyage across the "sea of
darkness," in three little caravels, no larger than the modern yacht,
and far less seaworthy. Watch his devoted and anxious look, his
solitary self-communings, his all-night vigils under the silent stars.
See his motley crew, picked up at random in Palos streets, ignorant,
superstitious, and full of fears, dreading every added mile of the
voyage, and alarmed at the prevalent east winds which they thought
would never permit them to sail back to Spain; so that Columbus, on a
contrary head-wind springing up, thanked God with all the fervency of
his pious soul. Pursue his career in his later expeditions, hampered
by the mutinous vagabonds whom fate had thrust upon him as followers,
many of them desperadoes just out of jail. See his baffled endeavors
to maintain order and discipline among such a crew; to restrain their
excesses, curb their lawless acts of violence, and secure some
semblance of decency in their conduct toward the natives. Many of
them, we read, were so given over to idleness and sloth, that they
actually made the islanders beasts of burden, to carry them on their
backs. It is a most unhappy fact that the missionaries of the cross
were often accompanied by bands of miscreants, who wantonly broke
every commandment in the decalogue and trampled upon every precept of
the gospel. See him in his last voyage, beating about <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> the
rocks and shoals of an unknown archipelago, overtaken by West India
hurricanes, almost engulfed in waterspouts, scudding under bare poles
amid perilous breakers, blinded by lightning, deafened by incessant
peals of thunder, his crazy little barks tossed about like
cockle-shells in the raging waves, his anchors lost, his worm-eaten
vessels as full of holes as a honey-comb, two caravels abandoned, and
the two remaining run ashore at Jamaica, where Columbus built huts on
their decks to shelter his forlorn crew. See him stranded here,
pressed by hunger and want, visited by sickness and almost blindness,
burning with fever under the wilting, fiery heat of the tropics,
desolate, forsaken, infirm, and old. There he lay a whole year without
relief, until the cup of his misery was full.</p>

<p>If Columbus was sometimes harsh and cruel, we are to remember that he
lived in an age when the most cruel and barbarous punishments were
common. There are numerous instances of his clemency both to natives
and to his revolted Spaniards, and he more than once jeopardized his
own life by sparing theirs. Among a treacherous and vindictive race,
many of whom were continually plotting for his overthrow, the admiral,
endowed with full power over the lives and acts of his followers, was
compelled to make examples of the worst, many of whom were criminals
released from the prisons of Spain. Like other fighters, he met
treachery with treachery, cruelty with cruelty. He had never learned
to love his enemies, nor to turn his cheek for the second blow. Show
us the man invested with absolute power, in that or in any former age,
who abused it less. Try him by the moral standards, not of our humane
and enlightened age, but by those of his own. Compared with the deeds
of darkness that were done by Bobadilla and Ovando, the governors who
replaced him, the reign of Columbus appears, even at its worst, to
have been mild and merciful.</p>

<p>By the side of the atrocities and cruel massacres perpetrated under
Cortes in Mexico, and Pizarro in Peru, the few deeds of blood under
Columbus appear slight indeed. While we have no right to extenuate his
errors and his abuses, we have as little right to hold him to a
standard nowhere set up in his day. He had learned his ethics in a
school which taught that, for great and pious objects, the end
justified the means. In the ardor of his zeal for what he deemed the
Christian faith, Columbus committed many glaring mistakes and errors;
but what over-zealous apostle or reformer has failed to do the same?
Columbus was unduly eager after gold, they say; but in our advanced
age, when that which Virgil called "the accursed hunger for gold"
pervades all ranks, and our cities are nothing but great encampments
of fortune-hunters, does it lie in our mouths to condemn him?</p>

<p>The age of Columbus took him as he was&mdash;all full of human
imperfections and frailties, but full also to overflowing with a great
idea, and with a will, a perseverance, a constancy, and a faith so
sublime, as fairly to conquer every obstacle, after a weary struggle
of eighteen years, and to carry forward his arduous enterprise to
triumphant success. That the great discoverer failed as a governor and
administrator makes nothing against his merits as a discoverer. That
his light at last went out in darkness&mdash;that the world he discovered
brought nothing to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span> Spain but disappointment and Dead Sea
ashes&mdash;that he dragged out a miserable old age in rotten and
unseaworthy ships, lying ill in the torrid heats of the West Indies,
racked with excruciating pain, and in absolute penury and want&mdash;all
this but adds point to a life so full of paradox that we may almost
pardon him for believing in miracles. After so much glory and so much
fame, his life darkened down to its dreary and pathetic close. His
ardent soul went at last where wicked governments cease from
troubling, and weary mariners are at rest. On May 20, 1506, worn out
by disease, anxieties, and labors, the great discoverer launched forth
on his last voyage of discovery, beyond the border of that unknown
land whose boundaries are hid from mortal ken.</p>

<p>His place among the immortals is secure. By the power of the
unconquerable mind with which nature had endowed him, he achieved a
fame so imperishable that neither the arrows of malice, nor the shafts
of envy, nor the keenest pens of critics, nor the assaults of
iconoclasts can avail to destroy it.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>Vasco da Gama was the pet of fortune. Never did a man win immortality
more easily. As a discoverer and a navigator he should rank not only
below Columbus, but also below Bartolemeo Diaz and Cabral among his
own countrymen, as well as Vespucius and Magellan, who carried the
Spanish flag, and the Cabots, who established England's claim to the
most important portions of the New World. As a commander, an
administrator, and ruler of newly discovered regions, however, he
ranks easily above them all. He not only led the way to India, but
laid securely the foundations of Portuguese empire in the East.</p>

<p>Even in the hour of his birth he was fortunate. Prince Henry, surnamed
"the Navigator," to whose indefatigable exertions for more than forty
years was due that impulse to maritime achievement of which the
discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were the result,
had just died, and his influence hung like an inspiration over the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> little kingdom for which he had wrought with such
self-denying patience. This grandson of John of Gaunt has received
scant credit for that wonderful series of discoveries by which the
accessible earth was more than quadrupled in extent. Yet without him,
there is no reason to believe that either the coast of Africa would
have been explored, the Cape of Good Hope passed, or the American
continents discovered for a century, at least, perhaps for two or
three centuries afterward. He was the father of discovery, and it was
his hand more than any or all others that rolled up the curtain of
darkness which hid the major part of the habitable globe. All the
navigators and discoverers of that marvellous age were but the agents
of his genius and the creatures of his indefatigable exertion.</p>

<p>The son of the most noted sovereign of Portugal, and grandson of that
rugged Englishman from whose loins have sprung so many royal lines, he
was fitted by descent and training for the heroic part which he
performed. Distinguished for military achievement before he had come
to man's estate, urged by four of the leading sovereigns of Europe to
take command of their armies, and made Grand Master of the Order of
Christ before he was twenty-five, there is hardly any limit to the
military distinction he might have won or the power he might have
secured, had he sought his own advancement.</p>

<p>But he gave himself to Portugal, and determined to raise the little
kingdom his father had so gallantly held against jealous and powerful
neighbors, to the rank of a first-class power. To seek to enlarge a
realm shut in by mountains on one side and the sea upon the other, by
constant strife with embittered enemies, he saw at once was to invite
annihilation. The sea afforded the only avenue of hope, the continent
of Africa, where his father had already gained something from the
Moor, in battling with whom he had himself won renown, the only
visible opportunity. So he determined to explore, and finally, to
circumnavigate Africa, and give to Portugal whatever of power or
wealth the ocean or the dark continent might hide. He believed that
India might be reached by sailing round its southern extremity, and he
determined to pour the wealth of the Orient into the treasury of the
kingdom his father had established.</p>

<p>In 1418, therefore, he turned his back on personal ambition, laid
aside the glory of military renown, and sat himself down to a hermit's
life and a scholar's labors on the promontory of Sagres, in the
province of Algarve, that point on the coast of Portugal which
stretches farthest out into the Atlantic in the direction of his hope.
Here he built an observatory whose light was the last his captains saw
as they went forth, and the first to greet them on their return. Here
he opened a school of navigation, and here were trained the
discoverers who opened the way for all who came afterward. Here was
not only nourished the impulse which fired the hearts of Columbus and
his contemporaries, but here was taught the science and here were
gathered the facts which enabled them to achieve success.</p>

<p>Up to that time, Cape Nun had been the boundary of the modern world to
the southward. With infinite patience, Prince Henry labored to
convince his captains that the terrors which they thought lay at the
southward of this point were wholly imaginary. Little by little his
caravels crept down the coast of Africa. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> Every year he sent
out two or three. Navigators and geographers flocked to his service.
In two years he re-discovered Madeira and Porto Santo, of which latter
he afterward made Perestrello, the father of Columbus's wife, the
governor. By 1433 his ships had reached Cape Bojador; eight years
afterward they passed Cape Blanco; in 1445 they were at the mouth of
the Senegal. Still he urged them on toward that "<i>thesaurus Arabum et
divitia Indiæ</i>," to which he set himself the task of opening up the
way. The crown of Portugal assumed all the cost of these expeditions.
Gold, ivory, cinnabar, dye-woods, spices, and slaves, added to the
wealth of the kingdom only to furnish forth new ventures.</p>

<p>He died before the end came, but not until many of the most important
problems of cosmographic condition had been solved. It was known by
actual experience that the "steaming sea" was a myth. Ships had
crossed the equator, and their crews came back to tell of
southward-stretching shadows. Ships were able, it was seen, to sail up
the southern slope of the world as well as down it. Why they did not
fall off into space, none knew, but that they did not was proved.
Gravitation was a force whose laws and character were yet
unformulated. The diurnal motion of the earth was hardly suspected
until a hundred years later. But the facts on which these two
fundamental truths are based were being gathered for Newton and
Copernicus. When he died, those whom he had inspired and instructed
continued the work to which he had devoted himself, under the
patronage of his brother Alfonso and his nephew João II.; until, in
1486, Bartholomeo Diaz had sailed two hundred miles to the eastward of
the Cape of Good Hope and returned to assure his sovereign that the
way to India had at length been found.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until Dom Manoel had succeeded to the throne, in
1495, that any successful effort was made to follow up the success
which Diaz had achieved. The way to India was indeed open, but no one
seems to have had sufficient fortitude to undertake so long a voyage
in order to reach it by that route. Dom Manoel had, however, but one
idea. He was not a geographer like his predecessor, João, "the
perfect," but he was a man of action, and determined that the route
Prince Henry's navigators had opened to India should not remain
unused. Vasco da Gama was then in his thirty-fifth year, the
handsomest man of his age, of ancient family, and it is claimed was
not without royal blood in his veins. As a soldier he was trained in
the war with Castile; as a navigator he had served under Prince
Henry's best captains. Camoens, the historical poet of Portugal,
declares that he was familiar not only with the recorded achievements
of his predecessors, but with all the regions they had discovered. Dom
João, on the return of Diaz, selected him to command the fleet he
meant to send to follow up this discovery. In the ten years that
elapsed before he actually sailed, it is probable that he had grown to
be not only a better geographer, but also a stronger, more
cool-headed, and reliable man. That he was able to command, those
mutineers who cavilled at his severity during the stormy passage of
four months from Lisbon to Table Bay, found out when they demanded
that he give up trying to reach India and return to Portugal as other
captains had done, at the behest of their crews. He made short work
of them, and in his whole career, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> so salutary was the lesson,
no one under his command ever again refused to obey his orders.</p>

<p>It was July 8, 1497, when he sailed from Lisbon, and it was not until
December 1st that he left Delagoa Bay, the farthest eastward point
which Diaz had reached, to pass over the actually unknown water that
lay between him and India. Even this could hardly be called "unknown
water," for Corvilhan, who a dozen years before had made his way
overland to Aden, had sent back to Dom João II. this message:</p>

<p>"Anyone who will persist, is sure to sail around the southernmost
point of Africa, and can then easily make his way up the eastern shore
and across the gulf to India."</p>

<p>Literally were his words fulfilled. With favoring breezes, Gama
reached Malinda early in January, 1498, and securing the services of
an Indian pilot, who had not only sailed hither from Calicut, but
seemed as familiar as Gama himself with compass and astrolabe, he set
out boldly across the Indian Ocean, and in May arrived at Calicut.
When we consider that this latter part of the voyage was with a pilot
accustomed to make the trip in the far more fragile crafts of the
Arabs, the boldness of the undertaking does not seem so apparent to
one of our day. Compared with the voyages of Columbus, Magellan,
Vespucius, or Cabral over absolutely unknown seas, without pilots or
charts of any kind, the passage from Aden to India hardly seems
remarkable. Yet upon this the fame of Gama as an explorer rests, and
as has been remarked, "few men have won fame so easily." His real
merit lay in the fact that he did what so few of his predecessors were
able to accomplish, controlled the mutinous crews, who had after all
been the most serious obstacle in the path of Portugal to the coveted
Indian possessions. It is probable that if Prince Henry had encouraged
his captains to exercise greater severity, the darling object of his
life might have been attained before his death and the birth of the
fortunate explorer, whose cheaply-won fame has obscured his own, even
with the king-loving Portuguese.</p>

<p>It would seem as if the capacity to control men, which was so
prominent a characteristic of the "Discoverer of India," was not of a
conciliatory character, for the Zamorin of Calicut received him but
coldly, and before his ships were loaded the difference had ripened
into a quarrel, and he was obliged to cut his way out of the harbor to
begin his homeward voyage. This lack of complaisance on the part of
the Zamorin he attributed, not without reason, to the jealousy of the
Arab merchants, whose swift-sailing dhows crowded the port. Why should
they not be jealous of him who came to take away their immemorial
privilege? Theretofore the treasures of the Orient had reached the
western world only through the hands of the Arab merchants. The dhow
and the camel had been its carriers. Gama had brought the more
capacious caravel to bear them over a new highway to the western
consumers. His success meant the loss of a great part of the business
on which the sailors, merchants, and camel-drivers of Arabia depended
for a livelihood. Why should they not conspire to kill him and destroy
his fleet?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> His homeward passage was as fortunate as the outward one had
been. That he did not experience the disasters which befell others,
was no doubt largely due to the fact that he foresaw and avoided peril
whenever possible. He was one of those men who, while shrinking from
no unavoidable danger, take no unnecessary risks. He was received with
unprecedented honors when, after two years and two months' absence,
his ships were again anchored in the Tagus. Their rich cargo attested
the rare value of the trade he had opened up. Despite the gold which
the miners of Española were beginning to send to Spain, and the pearls
which had come from Cubagua, the apparent value of the discoveries of
Columbus were as nothing to the boundless wealth which Gama's voyage
assured to Portugal. By the bull of Pope Alexander VI., all lands
discovered east of the meridian of the Azores belonged to the King of
Portugal. It was not only half the world, but that half which was of
most inexhaustible richness, Asia and Africa. Titles and honors and
wealth were conferred upon the fortunate explorer. In consideration
perhaps of his royal extraction, he was permitted to affix the kingly
title, "Dom," to his name. No wonder he was thus honored, when the
cargo of one small caravel loaded with spices, yielded a greater sum
than the whole outfit of the fleet Columbus commanded on his first
voyage!</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time, thirteen ships were fitted out, and under
that prince of navigators, Cabral, set sail to secure the results of
Gama's discovery. On him, too, fortune smiled as it rarely has on them
that "go down to the sea in ships." Blown out of his course by
head-winds, his very mishaps ripened into the rarest fortune, for he
discovered Brazil, and thus added to his master's realm what was
destined to be one of the richest kingdoms of the world. With the
instinct of genius, and a courage as rare as it was heroic, he did not
return to notify his king of the new continent which had risen out of
the deep before him, but sending back a single caravel with the
marvellous news, he turned his battered prows to that point of the
compass where he judged the Cape of Good Hope to be, and after passing
three thousand miles of water that had never known a keel before, he
rounded the southern point of Africa and proceeded to carry out his
orders. He lacked, however, the soldierly qualities and administrative
power of the "Discoverer of India," who the year after his return was
sent out to complete his work. This time he had a fleet of twenty
sail, and from the outset was bent not only on taking permanent
possession of the countries whose trade it was desirable to secure,
but on avenging the affront that had before been offered him by the
Zamorin of Calicut and the Arab traders who had inspired the action.</p>

<p>On his way he founded the colonies of Mozambique and Sofala, and
sailed to Travancore. During the passage he fell in with a ship which
was carrying many Indian Mussulmans to Mecca, laden with rich presents
for the shrine of the Prophet. This he pillaged and burned, with all
of her 300 passengers except twenty women and children, whom he saved
more for his own pleasure, no doubt, than from any pity for them. He
excused this act of savagery, so far as any excuse was necessary, on
the ground that they were paynim Moors, and some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> among them
had incited the attack upon him at Calicut on his former voyage. The
truth is they were rich; he wanted the plunder; and there was less
likelihood of trouble if he killed them than if they were left alive
to publish and avenge their losses. It was merely an application of
the freebooter's maxim, that "dead men tell no tales."</p>

<p>Arriving at Calicut, he found that forty Portuguese who had been left
to establish a permanent post, had been killed. With unusual
deliberation, he investigated the matter and demanded reparation,
submission, and a treaty acknowledging the sovereignty of Portugal
over India. This being refused, he bombarded the city, burned the
ships in the harbor, and compelled the Zamorin himself and all the
native princes of the region to submit and acknowledge themselves
feudatories of Portugal. So rapid were his movements, and so accurate
his calculations, that before the close of 1503 he had reached Lisbon
again with thirteen vessels laden to the gunwale with the plunder of
the Orient&mdash;by all odds the richest argosy that had come to any
European port since the days of the Romans.</p>

<p>Da Gama was now forty-three years old, and must have been in the very
prime of manhood. Why so skilled a navigator, so intrepid a commander,
so shrewd a negotiator, and so successful an administrator, who had
established the power of Portugal from Delagoa Bay to Calcutta,
should, at that period of his life, have been laid upon the shelf for
twenty years, is a conundrum hard to answer. Knowing the character of
Dom Manoel, it is not difficult to guess that his sordidness lay
somewhere at the bottom of the trouble; but it is said to Gama's
credit, that he neither whined nor remonstrated.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, however, that he was succeeded by one who was
greatly his superior both as a general, a statesman, and an
administrator. If Vasco da Gama laid the foundations of Portuguese
empire in the East, Alfonso d'Albuquerque, "the Great," broadened and
built upon them as he could never have done. From Aden to Cochin blood
flowed beneath his blows, but peace followed; and though he was termed
"the Portuguese Mars," his justice became traditional, and his
sagacity was shown in the permanence of the settlements he made, even
under the incompetent viceroys who followed him.</p>

<p>It was twenty years since Vasco da Gama had commanded a ship.
Albuquerque was dead, and his successors had brought shame and defeat
upon the Portuguese power in the East. Dom Manoel was dead also, and
whatever grievance he had against "the Discoverer of India," seems to
have died with him. His successor, Dom João III., casting about for
someone to bring order out of confusion, success out of failure, and
honor out of shame, called again into his service the courtly and
sagacious mariner, now over sixty years of age; and conferring upon
him the title of viceroy, sent him to retrieve the prestige his
successors had lost. His high spirit was yet undaunted, and when he
neared the coast of India and found the waters in a strange ferment
for which no one could account, as there was neither wind nor tide, he
said loftily: "The sea beholds its conqueror and trembles before him!"
It sounds bombastic, but in the mouth of one who had first guided a
civilized keel over its surface, such arrogance is at least
pardonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> In the few months that intervened before his death he made
the power of Portugal once more respected in the East. When he died in
Cochin, in 1525, he was mourned by the natives as a just ruler, and by
his countrymen as one who had saved to Portugal the richest part of
the national domain. It is not strange, therefore, that when his ashes
were conveyed to Lisbon, they were received with a pomp almost equal
to that which greeted him when he came as the discoverer of the Orient
and its priceless treasures. It is rare in history that one receives
two triumphs, the one while living and the other when dead, especially
in connection with the same achievement; but it is rarer still that
one who has won immortality should leave a record so singularly free
from bickering and strife as that of the dignified and self-contained
Portuguese rival of Columbus, Dom Vasco da Gama, the "Discoverer and
Sixth Viceroy of India, Count of Vidigueira," where he lies entombed.
Little is known of his private life; but there seems no doubt that it
was free from the stains that obscure his great rival's fame, from
whom he also differed in the fact that he neither begged nor boasted,
and in old age was honored even more than in his prime.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>THE CHEVALIER BAYARD<br>

By <span class="smcap">Herbert Greenhough Smith</span><br>

(1476-1524)</h3>

</div>

<p>Pierre Du Terrail was born in 1476, at Castle Bayard, in Dauphiny. The
house of Terrail belonged to the Scarlet of the ancient peers of
France. The Lords of Bayard, during many generations, had died under
the flags of battle. Poictiers, Agincourt, and Montlhéry had taken, in
succession, the last three; and in 1479, when Pierre was in his
nurse's arms, his father, Aymon du Terrail, was carried from the field
of Guinegate with a frightful wound, from the effects of which,
although he survived for seventeen years to limp about his castle with
the help of sticks, he never again put on his shirt of mail.</p>

<p>The old knight was thus debarred from bringing up his son as his own
squire. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> But the Bishop of Grenoble, his wife's brother, was a
close friend of Charles the Warrior, the great Duke of Savoy. When
Pierre was in his fourteenth year it was proposed that he should begin
his knightly education among the pages of the duke. The bishop
promised to present him. A little horse was bought; a tailor was set
to work to make a gorgeous suit of silk and velvet; and Pierre was
ready to set out.</p>

<p>During six months the palace of Charles became his home. The lovable
and handsome boy soon won all hearts about him. The duke with delight
saw him leap and wrestle, throw the bar, and ride a horse better than
any page about the court. The duchess and her ladies loved to send him
on their dainty missions. His temper was bright and joyous; his only
fault, if fault it can be called, was an over-generosity of nature.
His purse was always empty; and when he had no money, any trifling
service of a lackey or a groom would be requited with a silver button,
a dagger, or a clasp of gold. And such was to be his character through
life. Time after time, in after years, his share of treasure, after
some great victory, would have paid a prince's ransom; yet often he
could not lay his hand on five gold pieces.</p>

<p>When Pierre had lived at the palace about half a year, the duke made a
visit to Lyons, to pay his duty to the king. That king was Charles the
Eighth, then a boy of twenty, who was making his days fly merrily with
tilts and hawking parties, and his nights with dances and the whispers
of fair dames. The duke desired to carry with him to his sovereign a
present worthy of a king's acceptance. A happy notion struck him. He
resolved to present the king with Bayard and his horse.</p>

<p>King Charles, delighted with his new page, placed him in the palace of
Lord Ligny, a prince of the great house of Luxemburg, and there for
three years he continued to reside. During that time his training was
the usual training of a page. But the child was the father of the man.
Thoughts of great deeds, of tilts and battle-fields, of champions
going down before his lance, of crowns of myrtle, and the smiles of
lovely ladies&mdash;such already were the dreams which set his soul on
fire.</p>

<p>At seventeen Pierre received the rank of gentleman. Thenceforward he
was free to follow his own fortune; he was free to seek the glorious
Dulcinea of his dreams&mdash;a fame as bright and sparkling as his sword.
And thereupon begins to pass before us, brilliant as the long-drawn
scenes of a dissolving view, the strange and splendid series of his
exploits. He had not ceased to be a page ten days before the court was
ringing with his name.</p>

<p>Sir Claude de Vauldre, Lord of Burgundy, was regarded as the stoutest
knight in France. He was then at Lyons, and was about to hold a tilt,
with lance and battle-axe, before the ladies and the king. His shield
was hanging in the Ainay meadows, and beside it Montjoy, the
king-at-arms, sat all day with his book open, taking down the names of
those who struck the shield. Among these came Bayard. Montjoy laughed
as he wrote down his name; the king, Lord Ligny, and his own
companions, heard with mingled trepidation and delight <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> that
Bayard had struck the blazon of Sir Claude. But no one had a thought
of what was coming. The day arrived, the tilt was held, and Bayard, by
the voice of all the ladies, bore off the prize above the head of
every knight in Lyons.</p>

<p>The glory of this exploit was extreme. It quickly spread. Three days
later Bayard went to join the garrison at Aire. He found, as he rode
into the little town, that the fame of his achievement had arrived
before him. Heads were everywhere thrust out of windows, and a band of
fifty of his future comrades issued on horseback from the garrison to
bid him welcome. A few days after his arrival he held a tilt in his
own person, after the example of Sir Claude. The palms were a diamond
and a clasp of gold. Forty-eight of his companions struck his shield,
and rode into the lists against him. Bayard overthrew the whole band,
one by one, and was once more hailed at sunset by the notes of
trumpets as the champion of the tourney.</p>

<p>It is not in tournaments and tilts, however, that a knight can win his
spurs. Bayard burned for battle. For many months he burned in vain;
but at last the banners of the king were given to the wind, and
Bayard, to his unspeakable delight, found himself marching under Lord
Ligny against Naples.</p>

<p>The two armies faced each other at Fornovo. The odds against the
French were six to one, and the fight was long and bloody. When the
great victory was at last decided, Bayard was among the first of those
called up before the king. That day two horses had dropped dead
beneath him; his cuirass and sword were hacked and battered, and a
captured standard, blazing with the arms of Naples, was in his hand.
At the king's order he knelt down, and received upon the spot the rank
of knight. At one bound he had achieved the height of glory&mdash;to be
knighted by his sovereign on the field of battle.</p>

<p>Bayard was not yet nineteen. His figure at that age was tall and
slender; his hair and eyes were black; his complexion was a sunny
brown; and his countenance had something of the eagle's.</p>

<p>He was now for some time idle. He was left in garrison in Lombardy.
But fiercer fields were soon to call him. Ludovico Sforza took Milan.
At Binasco, Lord Bernardino Cazache, one of Sforza's captains, had
three hundred horse; and twenty miles from Milan was Bayard's place of
garrison. With fifty of his comrades he rode out one morning, bent on
assaulting Lord Bernardino's force. The latter, warned by a scout of
their approach, armed his party, and rushed fiercely from the fort.
The strife was fought with fury; but the Lombards, slowly driven back
toward Milan, at length wheeled round their horses and galloped like
the wind into the city.</p>

<p>Bayard, darting in his spurs, waving his bare blade, and shouting out
his battle-cry of "France," was far ahead of his companions. Before he
knew his danger, he had dashed in with the fugitives at the city gates
and reached the middle of the square in front of Sforza's palace. He
found himself alone in the midst of the fierce enemy&mdash;with the white
crosses of France emblazoned on his shield.</p>

<p>Sforza, hearing a tremendous uproar in the square, came to a window of
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> palace and looked down. The square was swarming with the
soldiers of Binasco, savage, hacked, and bloody; and in the centre of
the yelling tumult, Bayard, still on horseback, was slashing at those
who strove to pull him from his seat.</p>

<p>Sforza, in a voice of thunder, bade the knight be brought before him.
Bayard, seeing that resistance was mere madness, surrendered to Lord
Bernardino, and was led, disarmed, into the palace. Sforza was a
soldier more given to the ferocity than to the courtesies of war. But
when the young knight stood before him, when he heard his story, when
he looked upon his bold yet modest bearing, the fierce and moody
prince was moved to admiration. "Lord Bayard," he said, "I will not
treat you as a prisoner. I set you free; I will take no ransom; and I
will grant you any favor in my power." "My Lord Prince," said Bayard,
"I thank you for your courtesy with all my soul. I will ask you only
for my horse and armor." The horse was brought; Bayard sprang into the
saddle, and an hour later was received by his companions with raptures
of surprise and joy, as one who had come alive out of the lion's den.</p>

<p>Milan fell; Sforza was taken; and Bayard went into garrison at
Monervino. At Andri, some miles distant, was a Spanish garrison under
the command of Don Alonzo de Sotomayor, one of the most famous knights
in Spain. Bayard, with fifty men, rode out one morning, in the hope of
falling in with some adventure. It happened that he came across
Alonzo, with an equal party, abroad on the same quest. Their forces
met; both sides flew joyously to battle, and for an hour the victory
hung in the balance. But at last Bayard, with his own sword, forced
Alonzo to surrender; and his party, carrying with them a large band of
prisoners, rode back in triumph to the garrison.</p>

<p>Sotomayor behaved in most unknightly fashion, and after being
ransomed, accused Bayard of ill-treating him. Bayard sent him the lie,
and challenging him to a duel to the death, slew him. A few days
later, the Spaniards, panting for reprisal, proposed to meet a party
of the French in combat, for the glory of their nations. Bayard
received the challenge with delight. On the appointed day, thirteen
knights of either side, glittering in full harness, armed with sword
and battle-axe, and prepared for a contest to the death, rode forth
into the lists.</p>

<p>By the laws of such a tilt a knight unhorsed, or forced across the
boundary, became a prisoner, and could fight no longer. The Spaniards,
with great cunning, set themselves to maim the horses; and by these
tactics, eleven of the French were soon dismounted. Two alone were
left to carry on the contest, Bayard and Lord Orose.</p>

<p>Then followed such a feat of arms as struck the gazers dumb. For four
hours these two held good their ground against the whole thirteen. The
Spaniards, stung with rage and shame, spurred till their heels dripped
blood. In vain. Night fell; the bugles sounded; and still the
unconquerable pair rode round the ring.</p>

<p>But great as this feat was, it was soon to be succeeded by a greater.
A few weeks afterward the French and Spanish camps were posted on
opposite sides of the river Gargliano. Between them was a bridge, in
the possession of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> French; and some way farther down the
river was a ford, known only to the Spanish general, Pedro de Paez. He
proposed to lure the French guards from the bridge, and then to seize
it. And his stratagem was ready.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the French soldiers at the bridge were startled
to perceive a party of the enemy, each horseman bearing a foot-soldier
on his crupper, approach the river at the ford and begin to move
across it. Instantly, as Paez had intended, they left the bridge and
rushed toward the spot. Bayard, attended by Le Basque, was in the act
of putting on his armor. He sprang into the saddle, and was about to
spur after his companions, when he perceived, across the river, a
party of two hundred Spaniards making for the bridge. The danger was
extreme; for if the bridge were taken the camp itself would be in the
most deadly peril. Bayard bade Le Basque gallop for his life to bring
assistance. And he himself rode forward to the bridge, alone.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, on seeing a solitary knight advance against them,
laughed loudly at his folly. Their foremost horsemen were already
half-way over when Bayard, with his lance in rest, came flying down
upon them. His onset swept the first three off the bridge into the
river, and instantly the rest, with cries of vengeance, rushed
furiously upon him. Bayard, not to be surrounded, backed his horse
against the railing of the bridge, rose up in his stirrups, swung his
falchion with both hands above his head, and lashed out with such fury
that, with every blow a bloody Spaniard fell into the river, and the
whole troop recoiled in wonder and dismay, as if before a demon. While
they still stood, half-dazed, two hundred glaring at one man, a shout
was heard, and Le Basque, with a band of horsemen, was seen
approaching like a whirlwind. In two minutes the Spaniards were swept
back upon the land in hopeless rout&mdash;and the French camp was saved.</p>

<p>Bayard received for this great feat the blazon of a porcupine, with
this inscription, <i>Unus agminis vires habet</i>&mdash;"One man has the might
of armies."</p>

<p>And still came exploit after exploit in succession&mdash;exploits of every
kind of fiery daring. At Genoa, when the town revolted, Bayard stormed
the fort of the insurgents, quelled the riot, forced the city to
surrender, and hanged the leader on a pole. At Agnadello, against the
troops of Venice, he waded with his men through fens and ditches, took
the picked bands of Lord d'Alvicino on the flank, scattered them to
the winds, and won the day. At Padua, during the long siege, he
scoured the country with his band of horse, and frequently rode back
to camp at nightfall with more prisoners than armed men. At Mirandola,
where he faced the papal armies, he laid a scheme to take the Pope
himself. A snowstorm kept the fiery Julius in his tent, and Bayard
lost him. A few days afterward the pontiff's life was in his hands. A
traitor offered, for a purse of gold, to poison the Pope's wine. But
it is not the Bayards of the world who fight with pots of poison; and
the slippery Judas had to fly in terror from the camp, or Bayard would
infallibly have hanged him.</p>

<p>So far, amid his life of perils, Bayard had escaped without a wound.
But now his time had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span> Brescia was taken by the troops of Venice. Gaston de Foix,
the thunderbolt of Italy, marched with 12,000 men to its relief.
Bayard was among them. At the head of the storming-party he was first
across the ramparts, and was turning round to cheer his men to victory
when a pike struck him in the thigh. The shaft broke off, and the iron
head remained embedded in the wound.</p>

<p>Two of his archers caught him as he fell, bore him out of the rush of
battle, and partly stanched the wound by stripping up the linen of
their shirts. They then bore him to a mansion close at hand. The
master of the house, who seems to have been a person of more wealth
than valor, had disappeared, and was thought to be hiding somewhere in
a convent, leaving his wife and his two daughters to themselves. The
girls had fled into a hay-loft, and plunged themselves beneath the
hay; but, on the thunderous knocking of the archers, the lady of the
house came trembling to the door. Bayard was carried in, a surgeon was
luckily discovered close at hand, and the pike-head was extracted. The
wound was pronounced to be not dangerous. But Bayard, to his great
vexation, found he was doomed to lie in idleness for several weeks.</p>

<p>According to the laws of war, the house was his, and all the inmates
were his prisoners. And the fact was well for them. Outside the house
existed such a scene of horror as, even in that age, was rare. Ten
thousand men lay dead in the great square; the city was given up to
pillage, and it is said that the conquerors gorged themselves that day
with booty worth three million crowns. The troops were drunk with
victory and rapine. No man's life, no woman's honor, was in safety for
an instant.</p>

<p>Bayard set his archers at the door-way. His name was a talisman
against the boldest; and in the midst of the fierce tumult that raged
all round it, the house in which he lay remained a sanctuary of peace.</p>

<p>The ladies of the house were soon reassured. Bayard refused to regard
them as his prisoners or to take a coin of ransom. The daughters, two
lovely and accomplished girls, were delighted to attend the wounded
knight. They talked and sang to him, they touched the mandolin, they
woke the music of the virginals. In such society the hours flew
lightly by. The wound healed, and in six weeks Bayard was himself
again.</p>

<p>On the day of his departure the lady of the house came into his
apartment, and besought him, as their preserver, to accept a certain
little box of steel. The box contained two thousand five hundred
golden ducats. Bayard took it. "But five hundred ducats," he said, "I
desire you to divide for me among the nuns whose convents have been
pillaged." Then, turning to her daughters, "Ladies," he said, "I owe
you more than thanks for your kind care of me. Soldiers do not carry
with them pretty things for ladies; but I pray each of you to accept
from me a thousand ducats, to aid your marriage portions." And with
that he poured the coins into their aprons.</p>

<img src="images/img058.jpg" width="400" height="581" alt="" title="">
<p>Bayard taking Leave of The Ladies of Brescia.</p></div>

<p>His horse was brought, and he was about to mount, when the girls came
stealing down the steps into the castle court, each with a little
present, worked by their own hands, which they desired him to accept.
One brought a pair of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span> armlets, made of gold and silver
thread; the other, a purse of crimson satin. And this was all the
spoil that Bayard carried from the inestimable wealth of Brescia&mdash;the
little keepsakes of two girls whom he had saved.</p>

<p>The scenes of Bayard's life at which we have been glancing have been
chiefly those of his great feats of arms. And so it must be still; for
it is these of which the details have survived in history. And yet it
was such incidents as these at Brescia which made the fame of Bayard
what it was and what it is. To his foes, he was the flower of
chivalry; but to his friends, he was, besides, the most adored of men.
It is said that in his native province of Dauphiny, at his death, more
than a hundred ancient soldiers owed to him the roof that covered
their old age; that more than a hundred orphan girls had received
their marriage portions from his bounty. But of such acts the vast
majority are unrecorded; for these are not the deeds which shine in
the world's eye.</p>

<p>Gaston de Foix was now before Ravenna. Bayard rode thither with all
speed; he was just in time. Two days after his arrival came the
battle. Weak though he still was from his long illness, Bayard on that
day was seen, as ever, "shining above his fellow-men." He turned the
tide of victory; he tore two standards from the foe with his own hand;
and he was first in the pursuit.</p>

<p>Two months after, Bayard was at Pavia. The little troop with which he
was then serving had there sought refuge under Louis d'Ars. The armies
of the Swiss burst in upon them. Bayard, with a handful of soldiers in
the market-place, held, for two hours, their whole force at bay, while
his companions were retreating from the town across a bridge of boats.
As he himself was crossing, last of all, a shot struck him in the
shoulder, and stripped it to the bone. No surgeon was at hand. The
wound, roughly stanched with moss, brought on a fever, and for some
time he lay in danger of his life.</p>

<p>And now Bayard was to follow a new master. Louis XII. died; Francis I.
received the crown; and Bayard, with the young king, marched to Milan,
which the Swiss had seized and held.</p>

<p>On Thursday, September 13, 1515, King Francis pitched his camp at
Marignano, before the city of the spires. No danger of attack was
apprehended; the king sat calmly down to supper in his tent; when all
at once the Swiss, aroused to madness by the fiery eloquence of
Cardinal de Sion, broke like a tempest from the city, and fell upon
the camp. The French, by the red light of sunset, flew to arms, and
fought with fury till night fell. Both armies sat all night on
horseback, waiting for the dawn; and with the first streaks of
morning, flew again to battle. It was noon before the bitter contest
ended, and the Swiss, still fighting every inch of ground, drew slowly
back toward the city. It had been, indeed, as Trevulzio called it, a
Battle of the Giants. And the greatest of the giants had been Bayard
and the king.</p>

<p>That evening Francis held, before his tent, the ceremony of creating
knights of valor. But before the ceremony began, a proclamation by the
heralds startled and delighted all the camp. Francis had determined to
receive the rank in his own person. Bayard was to knight the king!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> In the days of the primeval chivalry, when even princes were
compelled to win their spurs, such a spectacle was not uncommon. But
not for ages had a king been knighted by a subject on a field of
battle. Nor was any splendor wanting that could make the spectacle
impressive. Nowhere in Ariosto is a picture of more gorgeous details
than is presented by this scene of history; the great crimson silk
pavilion, the seat spread with cloth of gold, the blazoned banners,
the heralds with their silver trumpets, the multitude all hushed in
wonder, the plumed and glittering company of knights and men-at-arms.
Such were the surroundings amid which Francis knelt, and Bayard, with
his drawn sword, gave the accolade.</p>

<p>The sword with which he had performed the ceremony Bayard kept
religiously until his death. It was then mislaid, and never
rediscovered. The loss is a misfortune. For few relics could exist of
more romantic interest than the sword with which the noblest of all
knights did honor to the most magnificent of kings.</p>

<p>Bayard's glory had long been at such a height that hardly any exploit
could increase it. And yet an exploit was at hand at which, even when
Bayard was the actor of it, all France and Germany were to stand in
wonder.</p>

<p>The German emperor, marching with a mighty army on Champagne, took
Monson by surprise, and advanced against Mézières. If Mézières were
taken, the whole province would be in the most deadly peril. And yet
defence seemed hopeless; the place had no artillery, and the ramparts
were in ruins. At this crisis Bayard volunteered to hold the crazy
city. "No walls are weak," he said, in his own noble style, "which are
defended by brave men."</p>

<p>With a small but chosen band he hastened to Mézières. Two days after
his arrival the Count of Nassau, with a vast array of men and cannon,
appeared before the walls. The siege began&mdash;a siege which seemed
impossible to last twelve hours.</p>

<p>But day after day went by, and still the town was standing. Every day
the ramparts gaped with cannon-shot; but every night, as if by
miracle, they rose again. The defenders suffered from wounds,
pestilence, and famine; but Bayard had put every man on oath to eat
his horse, and then his boots, before he would surrender. Three weeks
passed; and when at last the king arrived with forces to relieve the
town, he found a few gaunt spectres still glaring defiance from the
battered ramparts against a hundred cannon and more than forty
thousand men.</p>

<p>Nothing can more strikingly describe the part of Bayard than the
testimony of his enemies themselves. Some time after, Mary of Hungary
asked the Count of Nassau in disdain how it came to pass that with a
host of troops and guns he could not take a crazy pigeon-house.
"Because," replied the count, "there was an eagle in it."</p>

<p>It was Bayard's last great exploit. It had been his lifelong wish that
he might fall upon the field of battle. And so it was to be.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1524, the French camp was posted at Biagrasso.
Lord Bonnivet, who was in command, found himself, after a prolonged
resistance, at last compelled by famine and sickness to retire before
the Spaniards. It was Bayard's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span> constant custom to be first
in an advance and last in retreat, and that day he was, as usual, in
the post of danger. It was for the last time. Friends and enemies were
to hear, before night fell, the thrilling tidings that Bayard was no
more.</p>

<p>On both sides of the road which the retreating army had to traverse
the Spaniards had placed in ambush a large force of arquebusiers. It
was a weapon which Bayard held in detestation; for while skill and
courage were required to wield a spear or sword, any skulking wretch
could pull a trigger from behind a stone. From one of these hated
weapons he received his death. As he was retreating slowly with his
face toward the foe, a stone from a cross-arquebus struck him on the
side. He instantly sank forward on his saddle-bow, exclaiming in a
faint voice, "Great God! I am killed."</p>

<p>His squire helped him from his horse, and he was laid beneath a tree.
His spine was broken in two places; and he felt within himself that he
was dying. He took his sword, and kissed the cross-hilt, murmuring
aloud the Latin prayer, "<i>Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam
misericordiam tuam</i>."</p>

<p>The Spaniards were approaching. His friends made some attempt to raise
him and to bear him from the field. But the least movement made him
faint with agony; and he felt that all was vain. He charged his
companions, as they loved him, to turn his face toward the enemy, and
to retire into a place of safety; and he sent, with his last breath,
his salutation to the king. With breaking hearts they did as he
desired, and he was left alone.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards reached the spot, they found him still alive, but
sinking fast. The conduct of Lord Pescara, the Spanish general, toward
his dying foe, was worthy of a great and noble knight. He bade his own
pavilion to be spread above him; cushions were placed beneath his
head; and a friar was brought, to whom he breathed his last
confession. As he was uttering the final words, his voice faltered,
and his head fell. The friar looked upon his face&mdash;and saw that all
was over.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>GUSTAVUS VASA<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11" title="Go to footnote 11"><span class="small">[11]</span></a><br>

By <span class="smcap">Charles F. Horne</span><br>

(1496-1560)</h3>


<p>Three or four hundred years ago the little country of Denmark was of
much greater importance than it is to-day. It had the mightiest navy
in the world, and its rule over the seas was undisputed. Its
appearance on the map was also very different then, for it not only
extended over much of the German territory now surrounding it, but
also held all Norway as a province. Sweden, too, though often
rebelling, and being punished with terrible cruelty, was, up to the
year 1523, a dependency of the Danish crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span> Naturally the Danes rather looked down on the conquered
Swedes, and made them the subject of many rude jests and taunts. There
was in the beginning of the sixteenth century at the great Danish
university at Upsala a Swedish boy, who with the rest of his
countrymen must have suffered many such insults. His proud, brave,
little heart rebelled against this treatment; and one day, when his
teacher had driven him beyond endurance with his severe punishments
and bitter sneers, the boy snatched out his little sword and plunged
it straight through the master's book. "I will teach you something,
too," he cried; "teach you that the Swedes are no cowards, for some
day I will gather them together and treat every Dane in Sweden as I do
your book." Then he rushed out of the school, never to return.</p>

<a id="img059" name="img059"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img059.jpg" width="250" height="262" alt="Gustavus Vasa." title="">
</div>

<p>Many lads have, in some moment of passion made big boasts of what they
would do "some day." Few ever made so tremendous a vaunt; fewer still
ever so completely fulfilled their threats; and, perhaps, no one ever
struggled so patiently, so nobly, nor against such tremendous
obstacles before the goal was reached, as did this angry little Swede,
known to history as Gustavus Vasa. He was born in 1496, and was the
oldest son of Sir Eric Johansson, governor of a little group of
islands in the Gulf of Bothnia. Returning home after his precipitate
flight from school, Gustavus grew up under the eye of his stalwart
father, who trained him to be not only a strong and a shrewd man, but
also a good one.</p>

<p>Sent at the age of eighteen to the court of Svante Sture, the regent
governing Sweden, he threw himself eagerly into the great war for
freedom which his countrymen had begun under that mighty leader. This
struggle was so far successful that four years later King Christian,
of Denmark, utterly defeated on land and with his fleet in sore danger
anchored off Stockholm, and proposed a peace. He asked that hostages
be sent to remain on his ships, while he was on shore arranging the
treaty. This was readily agreed to, and the hostages went on board
without a thought of evil, the king having guaranteed their safe
return. Young Vasa, although only twenty-two, had already gained such
prominence among the patriots as to be one of those selected for this
duty. Just as he and his companions reached the ships, the wind, which
had hitherto blown from such a direction that King Christian was
unable to leave the harbor, suddenly changed, and the king as promptly
changing his plans, hoisted sail and fled from Stockholm, carrying
with him, as prisoners, the hostages whom he was bound in honor to
respect. But this grim and cruel old king never at any time let
himself be checked by his promised word; and now he seriously
considered slaying these men as rebels and traitors. Finally he
concluded to hold them as prisoners.</p>

<p>Gustavus was placed for safe keeping in the castle of Eric Bauer, a
Jutland noble, where he remained for two years. He lived on the very
poorest food, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> and far worse, had to endure taunts a hundred
times more bitter than those of his old school days, from the young
nobles about him. Worse still, he learned from them that King
Christian was gathering another and greater army with which to utterly
crush the rebellious Swedes; and he could neither warn his countrymen
nor raise a finger to give them help. But his courage and patience
never failed him. Through all that weary time he was always planning
and watching for a chance to escape. At last it came. Deceived by his
apparent indifference his jailers permitted him to ride, and even to
hunt with them, but always under a careful watch. One day, however,
the hunt grew so exciting that everyone forgot Gustavus and rode hard
and fast after the game. He saw his opportunity, and rode hardest and
fastest of all. Soon he was first in the race; but he did not stop
when he reached the captured deer. There was no one in sight and he
hurried on faster than ever. When his horse gave out he pressed
forward on foot, and nightfall found him forty miles from the castle.
He astonished a countryman by trading clothes with him; and the next
day, thus disguised, he hired himself to a drover to help him drive a
herd of cattle to the great German city of Lubeck. Probably no cattle
had ever been so driven before. Our hero knew well that the pursuit
would be fast and furious, and he kept the herd almost on a steady
run. The old drover was in a perpetual state of amazement; he did not
know whether to regard his new assistant as a madman or as the most
valuable hand he had ever hired. Gustavus never let the poor old
fellow rest a moment; he had to eat his meals as he walked, and even
to totter along half asleep. At last animals and men reached Lubeck,
all badly worn out, but safe, for Lubeck was a free city and a
powerful one, and when, an hour later, the enraged Eric Bauer galloped
up to its great gates, he knew that his prisoner was beyond his reach,
and that unless he could persuade the citizens to give him up there
was no chance of recapturing him.</p>

<p>The citizens did not give Gustavus up. He and his jailer were brought
face to face before the City Council to argue their case. When Eric
said his prisoner had broken his word in escaping, Gustavus related
how the king had broken his in the capture. When Eric threatened them
all with his master's wrath, the shrewd old burghers laughed. They
knew King Christian had other things to keep him busy enough, and that
he would think twice before attacking their great league of cities.
Besides, this young man had already shown that he could do great
things, and, as one of the Council said, "Who knows what he may win if
we send him home." So Eric was forced to leave without his captive;
and after some delay, during which he was treated with high honor,
Gustavus was sent home by the kind Lubeckers with the promise to help
him, if need be, with both men and money.</p>

<p>Indeed Sweden needed all the help she could get just then; but it did
not seem as though one man could do much for her. King Christian had
carried out his threats, and landing with a great army, defeated the
brave Sture and spread terror and destruction through all the land.
The tale of his cruelty and treacheries belongs rather to the history
of Sweden than of Gustavus. Enough to say <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> that, having by
promises of peace and pardon got all the leading Swedes into his
power, he had them murdered, and then he and his soldiers went on
slaying the common people right and left in mere wanton savagery. All
the surviving nobles were in his pay; the least suspicion of an
uprising was crushed with an iron hand, the least murmur of discontent
brought death. Never had Sweden seemed more helpless in the power of
the Danes.</p>

<p>To this unhappy country came Gustavus Vasa, and at once he was
declared an outlaw, and a great price was offered for his head; for
the king knew that here survived one man whom he could neither terrify
nor bribe. One castle still held out against the besieging Danes, and
for this Gustavus set out. But its defenders were disheartened by
their hopeless position, and were almost on the point of surrender.
They answered angrily to his brave words, and he left them to try and
rouse the peasantry all over the land.</p>

<p>Now began for him such a period of danger, sorrow, and privation, as
few men could have endured and lived. The land was filled with Danes
eager for his capture. The peasants were timid and disheartened. To
his passionate patriotic appeal they answered only, "We have salt and
herring still. If we rebel we will lose them too." Often they drove
him away with stones. Sometimes his own countrymen would have slain
him for the promised reward. At length it was no longer possible for
him to remain in Southern Sweden, and with a single servant he fled to
the highlands of Dalecarlia, a province in the north. From this on his
life reads like some wild romance of adventure. He had the grim
courage and grit and perseverance of a bull-dog. Nothing could
dishearten him in his seemingly hopeless and insane resolve to raise
the Swedes once more against Christian.</p>

<p>He found as much devotion in some places, as he did treachery in
others. Having crossed a ferry in advance of his servant, this latter
rode off with their small stock of money. Gustavus plunged his horse
into the river, and riding back after the faithless servitor, pursued
him all day straight back into the enemy's country, until the
terrified thief, abandoning horse and money and all, fled into the
woods. Gustavus recovered his property and pursued his course. The
Danes swarmed into Dalecarlia after him. He disguised himself as a
woodcutter, and lived as such. One day he met in the woods a giant
Dalesman named Liss Lars, and, as they were chatting together, a great
bear attacked Gustavus. After a fierce battle Lars slew the brute with
a blow of his axe. The two woodcutters became friends, and Lars got
his companion a place under the same master as himself, where Gustavus
remained a whole winter unsuspected. Often he himself was questioned
by the Danish spies, hunting for the now famous Vasa.</p>

<a id="img060" name="img060"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img060.jpg" width="600" height="486" alt="" title="">
<p>Abdication of Gustavus Vasa.</p></div>

<p>Once there was like to have been trouble between the two friends, for
Lars loved a maiden at the farm, who out of coquetry often smiled at
Gustavus, until the giant Dalesman became terribly jealous. One day
when she brought them their noon-day ale, she handed it first to
Gustavus, who, after drinking, returned it with a pleasant word and a
pat on the cheek. With a roar like a mad bull, Lars rushed on his
comrade and seized him in his giant arms. As he did so he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span>
saw around his neck the embroidered collar worn by the Swedish
nobility. The astounded Dalesman staggered back, pointing to it.
"Either thou art a thief, or the great Gustavus himself." "Ay, friend
Lars, I am the outlaw Gustavus, son of Eric. Now, wilt thou hand me
over to the Danes, or smash my head against the floor, as just now
thou seemedest minded?" "I will swear eternal fealty to thee," cried
Lars; "and if thou raisest the standard of revolt, I will be the first
to join."</p>

<p>Soon, however, even this retired spot became too unsafe, and Gustavus
fled farther north. Once an old schoolmate offered him shelter, and
then, while Gustavus slept, rode away to get help to capture him. But
the housewife, suspecting her husband's treachery, roused Gustavus,
who climbed through a window twenty feet from the ground, and escaped
on a horse the good woman had provided.</p>

<p>At another time, by burying himself in a load of hay he was carried
past some Danish soldiers who were searching for him. They thrust
their spears through the hay and then rode on. One of the spears
wounded the hidden man, and, seeing the blood trickle down, the
soldiers hurried back. But the driver had snatched out his knife and
given a slight cut to one of his horses; and when he pointed to this,
charging one of them with having done it, they rode away again
laughing at their own suspicions. In a hundred other equally dangerous
situations he escaped either by his own courage, or by the ready wit
of the brave Dalecarlian peasants; and at last the Danish spies gave
up the hunt for him, and returned to Stockholm.</p>

<p>Then he came forth again, and in ringing words urged the people to
revolt. But though they loved Gustavus, and loved Sweden, yet they
held back in doubt and fear from his daring plans; and so the hero
left them, and went on through the surrounding provinces, telling
everywhere of King Christian's cruelty, and sowing seed which was to
ripen later on. Yet nowhere could he rouse the peasants to action,
until word came that the cruel king had sworn to cut a hand and foot
from every man in Sweden, that they might never revolt again. Now all
felt that there was nothing left but fight. In great haste the
Dalecarlians sent after Gustavus and brought him back. They held a
great meeting, and to it came Gustavus' wood-cutter friend, Liss Lars.
He made a great homely speech, saying, "This Gustavus, son of Eric, is
a man. He has threshed with me, and I know him. We can trust him, and
sense has he, more than all of us put together. He must be our
leader."</p>

<p>All swore fealty to Gustavus; and he bade them make swords and spears
and arrows on their own anvils, while he went on again to rouse the
other provinces. King Christian had been called home by a rumor of
rebellion there, but his lieutenants thought to crush this little
uprising of the Dalecarlians as easily as they had a few others, and
one of them marched promptly there with a large force. The brave
peasants, led by Liss Lars and another, attacked him as he was
crossing a river and defeated him with great slaughter. Gustavus heard
rumors of the battle, and that his little army was destroyed. In wild
haste he galloped back to Dalecarlia to find them celebrating their
victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> Now did the men he had roused in every quarter come pouring
in; and he drilled them, and trained them, and encouraged them, became
head and hand and heart for them all, till soon he had such an army
that he might fairly hope to match any force the Danes could bring
against him. Then he sent out a proclamation declaring Christian
deposed for his cruel and bloody tyranny, and calling all true Swedes
to join him in making war upon the oppressor.</p>

<p>Thus did this young man at twenty-five become the leader of a great
rebellion, which he himself had created and controlled. He led his men
against one fortress after another. There were long sieges and
terrible battles; but Gustavus proved himself as great a general as he
was a man; and two years later, in 1525, Stockholm, the last town
remaining to the Danes in Sweden, surrendered to his army. Christian
himself had been unable to leave Denmark, but he was in constant
communication with his lieutenants, and wild was his rage at the
continued success of his young opponent. Gustavus's mother and sister,
with many other Swedish ladies, had fallen into the king's hands at
the time of those wholesale murders; and he tried to frighten the hero
with threats of what he would do to them; but poor Gustavus had
learned only too surely that most of them were already dead from his
cruel treatment. Finally this brute was deposed by his own subjects,
and a new king chosen. This king made some faint attempts to recover
Sweden, but he had small chance against such a man as Vasa.</p>

<p>The hero and his army entered Stockholm in triumph; and such of the
old nobles as were left, gathered in a council and offered him the
crown which he had wrested from Denmark. He refused it, saying he had
labored for his country, not himself, and bade the nobles choose from
among themselves some older man. But the whole country cried out that
they would submit to no man but him; he had freed them, he should rule
them. So there was, what seldom has been in history, a free choice of
a king by a united people; and Gustavus, son of Eric, became Gustavus
I., King of Sweden. Five years before he had been carried off a
helpless, almost friendless prisoner, by a mighty king. Now they had,
by sheer force of character, changed places; the king was in a
dungeon, Gustavus on a throne.</p>

<p>Though the remainder of our hero's life was less adventurous, it was
no less noble. He made, as all had foreseen, a great king, showing
himself as wise and high-minded as he had already proven brave and
patient. He found Sweden a petty province, he left it a mighty
kingdom; he found it a wilderness, poor, thinly peopled, and
semi-barbarous, he left it prosperous, populous, and civilized. He
himself was the head and centre of all this, performing an amount of
work which seems almost impossible for one man. His letters, some of
which remain, are clear, minute in detail, and exact. He knew just how
he wanted things done, and he had them done his way. His own life
might be summed up in his advice to his two sons, given when, only a
few months before his death, he resigned a crown grown too heavy for
his failing strength. "Think carefully, execute promptly, <i>never give
up</i>, never delay. Resolves not carried out are like clouds without
rain in times of drought."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, was the third child of James V. and his
wife, Mary of Guise. That lady had borne him previously, two sons,
both of whom died in infancy. Mary was born on December 7, 1542, in
the palace of Linlithgow. She was only seven days old when she lost
her father, who, at the time of her birth, lay sick at the palace of
Falkland.</p>

<p>The young queen was crowned by Cardinal Beaton, at Stirling, on
September 9, 1543. Soon after her birth, the Parliament nominated
commissioners, to whom they intrusted the charge of the queen's
person, leaving all her other interests to the care of her mother. The
first two years of her life, Mary spent at Linlithgow, where it is
said she had the small-pox, but the disease must have been of a
particularly gentle kind, having left behind no visible traces. During
the greater part of the years 1545, 1546, and 1547, she resided at
Stirling Castle, in the keeping of Lords Erskine and Livingstone. She
was afterward removed to Inchmahome, a sequestered island in the lake
of Monteith; after remaining there upward of two years, it was thought
expedient by those who had at the time the disposal of her future
destiny, that she should be removed to France. She was accordingly, in
the fifth year of her age, taken to Dunbarton, where she was delivered
to the French admiral, whose vessels were waiting to receive her; and
attended by Lords Erskine and Livingstone, her three natural brothers,
and four young ladies as companions, she left Scotland.</p>

<p>The thirteen happiest years of Mary's life were spent in France. She
was received at Brest, by order of Henry II., with all the honors due
to her rank and royal destiny. She travelled by easy stages to the
palace at St. Germain en <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> Laye; and to mark the respect that
was paid to her, the prison gates of every town she came to were
thrown open, and the prisoners set free. Shortly after her arrival she
was sent, along with the king's own daughters, to one of the first
convents in France, where young ladies of distinction were instructed
in the elementary branches of education.</p>

<p>Henry, to confirm the French authority in Scotland, was eager to marry
Francis, his son, to Mary. Francis, the young dauphin, who was much
about Mary's own age, was far inferior to her both in personal
appearance and mental endowments. They had been playmates from
infancy; they had prosecuted all their studies together; he loved her
with the tenderest affection; it was not in Mary's nature to be
indifferent to those who evinced affection for her; and if her
fondness for Francis was mingled with pity, it has long been asserted
that "pity is akin to love."</p>

<p>On April 24, 1558, the nuptials took place in the church of Notre
Dame, with great splendor. Every eye was fixed on the youthful Mary;
and, inspired by those feelings which beauty seldom fails to excite,
every heart offered up prayers for her future welfare and happiness.
She was now at that age when feminine loveliness is perhaps most
attractive. It is not to be supposed, indeed, that her charms, in her
sixteenth year, had ripened into that full-blown maturity which they
afterward attained; but they were on this account only the more
fascinating. Some have conjectured that Mary's beauty has been
extolled far above its real merits; and it cannot be denied that many
vague and erroneous notions exist regarding it. But that her
countenance possessed, in a pre-eminent degree, the something which
constitutes beauty, is sufficiently attested by the unanimous
declaration of all contemporary writers. Her person was finely
proportioned, and her carriage exceedingly graceful and dignified.</p>

<p>Shortly after the espousals, Mary and her husband retired to one of
their princely summer residences, where she discharged the duties of a
wife without ostentation. But the intriguing and restless ambition of
her uncles could not allow her to remain long quiet. About this time
Mary Tudor, who had succeeded Edward VI. on the English throne, died;
and although the Parliament had declared that the succession rested in
her sister Elizabeth, it was thought proper to claim for Mary Stuart a
prior right. But it was destined that there was to be another and more
unexpected death at the French court. Henry II. was killed at a
tournament by Count Montgomery. Francis and Mary succeeded to the
throne. Mary was now at the very height of European grandeur, for she
was queen of two powerful countries, and heir presumptive of a third.
She stood unluckily on too high a pinnacle to be able to retain her
position long. Francis died after a short reign of seventeen months,
and the heir to the throne Charles IX., being a minor, Catharine de
Medicis became once more virtually queen of France; and from her Mary
could expect no favors.</p>

<p>In August, 1561, Mary left France with tears, and was received in
Scotland with every mark of respect. She came, alone and unprotected,
to assume the government of a country which had long been
distinguished for its rebellious turbulence. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> Contrasted,
too, with her former situation, that which she was now about to fill
appeared particularly formidable. By whatever counsel she acted, the
blame of all unpopular measures would be sure to rest with her. If she
favored the Protestants, the Catholics were sure to renounce her, and
if she assisted the Catholics, the Protestants would be again found
assembling at Perth, listening, with arms in their hands, to the
sermons of John Knox, pulling down the remaining monasteries, and
subscribing additional covenants. Is it surprising, then, that she
found it difficult to steer her course between the rocks of Scylla and
the whirlpools of Charybdis? If misfortunes ultimately overtook her,
the wonder unquestionably ought to be, not that they ever arrived, but
that they should have been guarded against so long.</p>

<p>To further their political views, Mary's hand was sought for by
princes of the several European courts. The princes of the house of
Austria, apprehensive of the ambition of France, wished a union
between the Scottish queen and the Archduke Charles. Philip II.,
envying the Austrians so important a prize, used all his influence to
procure her hand for his son Don Carlos, heir to the extensive domains
of the Spanish monarchy. Catharine de Medicis, jealous of them both,
offered the hand of the Duke of Anjou, brother to her former husband,
and Elizabeth, the artful queen of England, recommended Lord Robert
Dudley, afterward Earl of Leicester.</p>

<p>Mary shunned all their intrigues, and followed the bent of her own
inclination in marrying Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, eldest son of the
Earl of Lennox. Darnley, at this time in the bloom of youth, was
distinguished for the beauty and grace of his person, and accomplished
in every elegant art; and he also professed the Catholic religion.
Darnley's qualifications, however, were superficial, and abandoning
himself to pleasure and the vices of youth, he became gradually
careless and indifferent toward the queen, whose disappointments and
mortifications were in proportion to the fervor of her former
sentiments. Her French secretary was one David Rizzio, who was
possessed of musical talents, and to whom she became much attached.
Darnley became jealous of Rizzio, and he, with a number of
conspirators, took possession of the palace on March 9, 1566, while
the queen was at supper with the Countess of Argyle and Rizzio. The
latter clung to the queen for protection, but he was torn from her and
dragged to the next apartment, where the fury of his enemies put an
end to his existence, by piercing his body with fifty-six wounds. The
conspirators put Mary under guard, but she escaped, and by the aid of
Bothwell and others, she was soon enabled to put her enemies at
defiance. This event served to alienate Mary's affections from
Darnley.</p>

<p>On June 19, 1566, the queen gave birth to a son; an event more
fortunate to the nation than to his unhappy mother, whose evil destiny
received aggravation from a circumstance which appeared so flattering
to her hopes.</p>

<p>Darnley, neglected by the queen, and despised by the people, remained
in solitude at Stirling, but alarmed by the rumor of a design to seize
his person, he thought fit to retire to his father at Glasgow. On his
way thither he was seized <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> with a dangerous illness. Mary
visited him, and it is said prevailed on him to be removed to the
capital, where she would attend on him. Kirk of Field, a house
belonging to the provost of a collegiate church, was prepared for his
reception. The situation, on a rising ground and in an open field, was
recommended for the salubrity of its air.</p>

<p>At two o'clock on the morning of February 10, 1567, the city was
alarmed by a sudden explosion. The house in which Darnley resided was
blown up with gunpowder. The dead body of Henry and a servant, who
slept in his room, were found lying in an adjacent garden, without
marks of violence, and untouched by fire. Thus perished Henry Stuart,
Lord Darnley, in his twenty-first year, a youth whom the indulgence of
nature and fortune had combined to betray to his ruin.</p>

<p>This execrable deed gave rise to various suspicions and conjectures,
which, while they glanced at the queen from her new sentiments with
regard to her husband, were, with a general consent, directed toward
Bothwell. A proclamation was issued from the throne, offering a
considerable reward for the murderer. Neither the power and greatness
of Bothwell, nor his favor with the queen, secured him from the
indignant sentiment of the nation. He had a mock trial, in which he
was acquitted.</p>

<p>The queen, on a journey from Edinburgh to Stirling, to visit her son,
was seized by a party of Bothwell's and conducted a prisoner to his
castle at Dunbar. Here he prevailed on her to marry him, and on her
subsequent appearance in public she was received with a sullen and
disrespectful silence by the people.</p>

<p>The transactions which had passed during the last three months in
Scotland were beheld by Europe with horror and detestation. The murder
of the king, the impunity with which his assassins were suffered to
escape, and the marriage of the queen with the man accused of being
their chief, were a series of incidents, which, for their atrocity and
rapid succession, were scarcely to be paralleled in the pages of
history. A general infamy fell upon the Scotch nation, which was
regarded, from these circumstances, as a people void of decency,
humanity, and honor.</p>

<a id="img062" name="img062"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img062.jpg" width="600" height="433" alt="" title="">
<p>Mary Stuart and Rizzio.</p></div>

<p>The discontented nobles confederated together and flew to arms.
Bothwell and Mary were unable to stem the opposition; she surrendered
to her enemies, and was conducted a captive to the castle of
Lochleven. Mary had for some weeks suffered the terrors of a prison;
of her deliverance there seemed to be but little prospect; no one had
appeared as her defender or advocate. Thus solitary, deserted, and
distressed, her persecutors reckoned on her fears and on her sex. Lord
Lindsay, the fiercest zealot of the party, was employed to communicate
their plan to the queen, and to obtain from her a subscription to the
papers with which he was charged. In the execution of his commission,
he spared neither harshness nor brutality; certain death was offered
to the unhappy victim, as the alternative of her refusal. Thus urged,
she yielded to the pressure of circumstances, and put her signature to
the papers presented to her by Lindsay. By one of these papers she
resigned the crown, renounced all share in the government, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span>
and consented to the coronation of the young king. By another, she
appointed Murray to the regency, and vested him with the powers and
privileges of the office. Pierced with grief, and bathed in indignant
tears, she signed the deed of her own humiliation, and furnished to
her adversaries the instrument of her abasement.</p>

<p>The people were not generally satisfied with the conduct of Murray,
the regent, and the scattered party of the queen began gradually to
reunite. Such was the disposition of the nation when Mary, through the
medium of George Douglas, a youth of eighteen, contrived to escape
from prison. She flew on horseback, at full speed, to Hamilton, where,
before a train of great and splendid nobles, and an army 6,000 strong,
she declared that the deeds signed by her during her imprisonment, and
the resignation of her crown, were extorted from her by fear. An
engagement between her forces and those of Murray took place at
Hamilton; her army was defeated. She stood on a hill and saw all that
passed. In confusion and horror she began her flight, and so terrible
was the trepidation of her spirits, that she stopped not till she
reached the abbey of Dunrenan, in Galloway, fully sixty Scottish miles
from the field of battle. In the space of eleven days she had beheld
herself a prisoner, at the mercy of her greatest enemies; at the head
of a powerful army, with a numerous train of nobles devoted to her
service; and a fugitive, at the hazard of her life, driven, with a few
attendants, to lurk in a corner of her kingdom. Still anxious and
agitated in her retreat, she was impelled by her fears to an
irretrievable step, fatal to all her future hopes. In vain her
attendants, with the lords Herries and Heming, implored her on their
knees not to confide in Elizabeth, her resolution was not to be
shaken, and to England she fatally resolved to fly. No longer an
object of jealousy, but compassion, Mary trusted in the generosity of
a sister queen, that she would not take advantage of her calamitous
situation. She got into a fisherman's boat, and with about twenty
attendants, landed at Workington, in Cumberland, whence, with marks of
respect, she was conducted to Carlisle.</p>

<p>She addressed, on her arrival in England, a letter to the queen, in
which she painted in glowing colors the injuries she had sustained,
and implored the sympathy and assistance which her present situation
so pressingly required. Elizabeth and her council deliberated upon the
course which, in this extraordinary event, it would be proper to
pursue; and at last determined, in spite of justice and humanity, to
avail herself of the advantages given her by the confidence of her
rival. Mary demanded a personal interview with Elizabeth, but this
honor she was told must be denied to her. She had no intention of
acknowledging superiority in the queen of England, who, she expected,
would, as a friend, herself receive and examine her defences. But
Elizabeth chose to consider herself as umpire between the Scottish
queen and her subjects; and she prepared to appoint commissioners to
hear the pleadings of both parties, and wrote to the Regent of
Scotland to empower proper persons to appear in his name, and produce
what could be alleged in vindication of his proceedings.</p>

<p>Mary, who had hitherto relied on the professions of Elizabeth, was by
this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span> proposal at once undeceived, and she was, in despite of
her remonstrances and complaints, conducted to Bolton, a castle of
Lord Scroop, on the borders of Yorkshire. Commissioners met on both
sides, and after protracted deliberations for four months, they left
things just as they found them.</p>

<p>The last eighteen years of Mary's life were spent in imprisonment, and
are comparatively a blank in her personal history. She was
transported, at intervals, from castle to castle, and was intrusted
sometimes to the charge of one nobleman, and sometimes to another; but
for her the active scenes of life were past; the splendor and dignity
of a throne were to be enjoyed no longer; the sceptre of her native
country was never more to grace her hands; her will ceased to
influence a nation; her voice did not travel beyond the walls that
witnessed her confinement. She came into England at the age of
twenty-five, in the prime of womanhood, the full vigor of health, and
the rapidly ripening strength of her intellectual powers. She was
there destined to feel, in all its bitterness, that "hope deferred
maketh the heart sick." Year after year passed slowly on, and year
after year her spirits became more exhausted, her health feebler, and
her doubts and fears confirmed, till they at length settled in
despair. Premature old age overtook her before she was past the
meridian of life; and for some time before her death, her hair was
white "with other snows than those of age." Yet, during the whole of
this long period, amid sufferings which would have broken many a
masculine spirit, and which, even in our own times, have been seen to
conquer those who had conquered empires, Mary retained the innate
grace and dignity of her character, never forgetting that she had been
born a queen, or making her calamities an excuse for the commission of
any petty meanness, which she would have scorned in the days of her
prosperity. Full of incident as her previous life had been, brilliant
in many of its achievements, it may be doubted whether the
forbearance, fortitude, and magnanimity displayed in her latter years,
do not redound more highly to her praise than all that preceded.
Elizabeth wished for some plausible pretext to take away the life of
the unhappy Mary, whom, though so defenceless, she regarded as a
dangerous rival. The Duke of Norfolk made offers of marriage to Mary,
to which she consented, in case she should be liberated. His scheme
also was to favor the Catholic cause, and on its being discovered he
was thrown into prison, where, after six months' confinement, he was
liberated, on condition of his holding no further intercourse with the
queen. He was, however, arrested the second time, and executed.</p>

<p>A conspiracy soon after took place, through the blind affection of the
English Catholics for Mary, and their implacable hatred of Elizabeth;
that, while it proved fatal to the life of one queen, has left on the
memory of the other an indelible stain. It was a conspiracy of two
zealous Catholics, to take the life of Elizabeth. The plot was
revealed in confidence to Anthony Babington, a young gentleman of
Derbyshire, possessing a large fortune and many amiable qualities,
whom the Archbishop of Glasgow had recommended to the notice of Mary.
The conspirators, through treachery, were arrested, and it is said two
letters from Mary were found with Babington. This was a pretext to
represent these fanatics <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> as the instruments of the captive
queen. Determined that no circumstance of solemnity suited to the
dignity of the person arraigned might be wanting, Elizabeth appointed,
by a commission under the great seal, forty persons, the most
illustrious in the kingdom for their rank and birth, together with
five judges, for the decision of the cause.</p>

<p>On October 11, 1586, the commissioners arrived at Fotheringay, where
Mary was confined. She solemnly protested her innocence of the crime
laid to her charge, and having never countenanced any attempt against
the life of Elizabeth, she refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of
the commissioners. "I came," said she, "into the kingdom an
independent sovereign, to implore the queen's assistance, not to
subject myself to her authority. Nor is my spirit so broken by past
misfortunes, or intimidated by present dangers, as to stoop to
anything unbecoming the majesty of a crowned head, or that will
disgrace the ancestors from whom I am descended, and the son to whom I
shall leave my throne."</p>

<p>Mary made her own defence; and her conduct before her judges displayed
the magnanimity of a heroine, tempered by the gentleness and modesty
of a woman. The judges were predetermined to find her guilty: the
trial was a mere pretence to give a sanction to their proceedings;
they were unanimous in declaring Mary "to be accessory to the
conspiracy of Babington, and to have imagined divers matters, tending
to the hurt, death, and destruction of Elizabeth, contrary to the
express words of the statute made for the security of the life of the
queen."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, February 7, 1587, the Earls of Shrewsbury and Kent arrived
at Fotheringay, and read in Mary's presence the warrant for her
execution, which was appointed for the ensuing day. "That soul," said
Mary, calmly crossing herself, "is unworthy the joys of heaven, which
repines because the body must endure the stroke of the axe. I submit
willingly to the lot which heaven has decreed for me; though I did not
expect the Queen of England would set the first example of violating
the sacred person of a sovereign prince." Then laying her hand on a
Bible, which happened to be near her, she solemnly protested her
innocence.</p>

<p>At the scaffold she prayed for the prosperity of her son, and for a
long and peaceable reign to Elizabeth. She hoped for mercy, she
declared, only through the death of Christ, at the foot of whose image
she willingly shed her blood. With intrepid calmness she laid her neck
on the block; her hands were held by one executioner, while the other,
with two blows, dissevered her head from her body. "So perish all the
enemies of Elizabeth!" exclaimed the dean, as he held up the streaming
head. "Amen," answered the Earl of Kent alone; every other eye was
drowned in tears; every other voice was stifled in commiseration.
Thus, after a life of forty-four years and two months, nineteen years
of which had been passed in captivity, perished the lovely and
unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img063.jpg" width="250" height="267" alt="Captain John Smith." title="">
</div>

<p>Of the antecedents of John Smith, Esquire, Captain and Knight, little
is recorded beyond the facts that he was of gentle blood and honorable
lineage, and that he was born in Lancashire, England, in 1579.</p>

<p>He was still under age when he enlisted as a private soldier and
fought with "our army" in Flanders. Sigismund Bathor, Duke of
Transylvania, was warring with the Turks, and young Smith, athirst for
adventure, next took service under him. Before the Transylvanian town
of Regall, he killed three Turkish officers in single combat, for
which doughty deed he was knighted. The certificate of Sigismund's
patent empowering the Englishman to quarter three Turks' heads upon
the family coat-of-arms is in the Herald's Office in London.</p>

<p>The tables were turned by his subsequent capture by the Turks. He was
sent to Tartary as a slave, not a prisoner of war, and compelled to
perform the most ignoble tasks, until, escaping by killing his brutal
master, he made his way by his wits to his native country in 1604. He
was now twenty-five years of age, and emphatically a soldier of
fortune. The tale of his prowess and adventures had preceded him, and
he was eagerly welcomed in London by kindred spirits who were
preparing to emigrate to America to form the colony of Virginia under
the grant and direct patronage of James I. By the time the enterprise
was ripe for execution, Smith had made himself so useful in counsel
and preparation that the king named him as one of the councillors of
the prospective colony.</p>

<p>The boundary lines of the royal grant were two hundred miles north,
and the same distance south, of the mouth of the James River, and east
and west "from sea to sea."</p>

<p>On December 19, 1606, the band of adventurers, 100 in number, embarked
at Gravesend in three small vessels. Christopher Newport was in
command, but Smith, and his close allies, Bartholomew Gosnold and
George Percy, a younger brother of the Duke of Northumberland, were
the ruling spirits of the voyagers. Carpenters and laborers were oddly
jumbled upon the list of emigrants with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> jewellers,
perfumers, and gold refiners, and "gentlemen" held prominence in
numbers and influence. The officers outnumbered the privates. The
little fleet was hardly out of the offing when the struggle for power
began. The voyage was not half accomplished when John Smith was
charged with complicity in a discovered mutiny. He had intended, it
was alleged, to murder his superiors, seize the fleet, and make
himself king of Virginia. The "General History of Virginia" tells how
serious an aspect the affair wore:</p>

<p>"Such factions here we had, as commonly attend such voyages, that a
paire of gallowes was made, but Captain Smith, for whom they were
intended, <i>could not be persuaded to use them</i>."</p>

<p>He was still under suspicion and arrest when the fleet anchored (May
13, 1607) in the broad river, Powhatan, to which the English explorers
gave the name of their king. Their first tents were pitched and first
cabins built upon a low peninsula flanked by extensive marshes. The
settlement received the name of Jamestown, in further demonstration of
loyalty.</p>

<p>When the king's sealed orders were opened, the name of John Smith
appeared second upon the roll of seven councillors appointed to govern
the infant colony. Next to him Gosnold was fittest for the responsible
position assigned to them. His death within three months after the
landing, left Smith the object of the envious distrust of Wingfield,
who had been elected president, and virtually alone in the honest
desire to found a permanent settlement in Virginia for ends he thus
sets forth:</p>

<p>"Erecting towns, peopling countries, informing the ignorant, reforming
things unjust, teaching virtue and gain to our native Mother Country."</p>

<p>There is a prophetic ring in this remarkable utterance of one whom his
contemporaries persisted in regarding as a reckless adventurer,
ambitious and unscrupulous. His frank denunciation of the feeble
measures of Wingfield and the selfish villainy of Ratcliffe, another
colleague, had earned the ill-will of the president and the relentless
hatred of Ratcliffe. Smith, being under arrest, was not allowed to
take his place among the councillors. He bided the day of justice with
patience learned from adversity. When the supreme opportunity came he
grasped it. An attack from hostile Indians proved Wingfield's
unfitness for the military command, and the alarmed colonists turned
instinctively to the bravest of their number. Wingfield anticipated
the uprising by reiterating his intention of sending Smith to England
for trial, for the double crime of mutiny and treason.</p>

<p>"The restive soldier suddenly flamed out. He would be tried in
Virginia as was his right&mdash;there was the charter! and the trial took
place. The result was a ruinous commentary on the characters of
Wingfield and the council. The testimony of their own witnesses
convicted them of subornation of perjury to destroy Smith. He was
acquitted by the jury of all the charges against him, and Kendall, who
had conducted the prosecution, was condemned to pay him £200 damages.
This sum was presented by Smith to the colony for the general use, and
then the foes partook of the commission, and the soldier was admitted
to his seat in the council." (Cooke's "History of Virginia.")</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> By autumn the settlement was fearfully reduced in numbers and
spirits. Fever, engendered by marshland malaria and famine, threatened
utter extinction.</p>

<p>"From May to September, those who escaped lived upon sturgeon and
sea-crabs; 50 in this time were buried," writes one of the sufferers.
"The rest, seeing the president's projects to escape these miseries in
our pinnace by flight (who all this time had neither felt want or
sickness), so moved our dead spirits as we deposed him and established
Ratcliffe in his place."</p>

<p>It was an exchange of inefficiency for deliberate wickedness, and in
the excess of continued misery the more reasonable of the victims
arose as a man and put Smith at the head of affairs.</p>

<p>The "terrible summer" left hardly ten men who could wield axe or hoe.
Smith himself was ill with malarial fever, yet nursed the sick, prayed
with the dying, and kept up the hearts of all by brave words and
braver action. He bought corn and meat of the Indians when they would
sell, and when they refused, secured supplies by intimidation. Yet we
find him, as soon as the immediate peril was over, again the
subordinate of envious leaders, and volunteering to satisfy
malcontents in America and in England, by heading a party in
mid-December to attempt the discovery of the great "South Sea," for so
long the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of Western adventurers.</p>

<p>The explorers sailed up the James, diverging here and there into the
tortuous creeks of the Chickahominy. When stopped by shallows, Smith
procured a canoe and Indian guides and pushed on with but two other
white men (Robinson and Emry) into the unknown wilderness, teeming
with spies jealous of the foreign intruders. Attempting to land at
"Powhatan," one of "the emperor's" residences, he and his guide sank
into the morass and were fired upon from the shore.</p>

<p>"The salvages ... followed him with 300 bowmen, led by the king of
Pamunkee, who, searching the turnings of the river, found Robinson and
Emry by the fire-side. These they shot full of arrowes and slew."</p>

<p>Smith bound the Indian guide to his arm and used him as a shield, thus
saving his own life. He was, however, captured, lashed to a tree, and
would have been killed, but for his address in presenting the King
Opecancanough with "a round ivory double compass Dyall"&mdash;his own
pocket compass&mdash;directing the attention of the "salvages" to the
movement of the needle, and describing the uses of the instrument.</p>

<p>"A month those Babarians kept him prisoner; many strange triumphes and
conjurations they made of him, yet he so demeaned himself among them
as he not only diverted them from surprising the Fort, but procured
his own libertie, and got himself and his company such estimation
among them that these Salvages admired him as a demi-god."</p>

<p>From the pen of a contemporary we have the account of what led to his
"libertie." He had killed two of the attacking party, and was
condemned by Powhatan to die for the offence.</p>

<p>Captain Smith saved by Pocahontas.</p></div>

<p>"Having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they could, a
long consultation was held; but the conclusion was, two great stones
were brought <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> before Powhatan, then, as many as could lay
hands on him, dragged him to them, and thereon laid his head, and
being ready with their clubs to beate out his brains, Pocahontas, the
king's dearest daughter, when no entreaty could prevaile, got his head
in her armes, and laid her owne upon his to save him from death;
whereat the emperor was contented he should live to make him hatchets,
and her bells, beads, and copper."</p>

<p>From other pages we get the stage-setting for this, the most dramatic
incident in colonial history.</p>

<p>The emperor had heard the evidence with a "sour look," sitting in
state upon a rude dais, covered with mats, his body wrapped in a cloak
of raccoon skins. His dusky harem was grouped about him, watchful and
interested. When the trial was over he bade one wife to bring water to
wash the captive's hands, another a bunch of feathers to dry them
upon. This was preliminary to the feast.</p>

<p>"So fat they fed Mee," says "A True Relation of Virginia," published
by Smith in 1608, "that I much doubted they intended to have
sacrificed mee to the Quioughquosiche, which is a superiour power they
worship."</p>

<p>The appointment to the position of armorer in the royal household, and
trinket-maker to the princess, was one of honor. Smith enjoyed it for
a month only, but to his residence at Powhatan and intimacy with
Pocahontas, he was indebted for the familiarity with Indian language
and customs which was afterward of incalculable benefit to the
Virginians. He describes Pocahontas in respectful admiration:</p>

<p>"For features, countenance, and expression she much exceeded the
rest."</p>

<p>Her gala attire was a doeskin mantle lined with down from the breasts
of wood-pigeons; bangles of coral bound her brown ankles and wrists,
and in her hair was a white heron's feather in token of her royal
blood. At the time of her rescue of Smith she was about thirteen years
old.</p>

<p>In January, 1608, the emperor offered Smith a forest principality if
he would remain with the tribe, but he petitioned to be allowed to
return to Jamestown. The request was reluctantly granted, and an
escort sent with him to the "Fort." This returned, bearing gifts for
Powhatan and his wives, with marvellous stories of the cannon-shot
fired into the sleety forest at Smith's command. We cannot but wonder
what toy or ornament went to the petted child whom he had served in
glad gratitude while a member of her father's household.</p>

<p>He had no time for sentimental musings. Upon the very day of his
unlooked for return (January 8, 1608), Ratcliffe repeated Wingfield's
attempt to escape to England in the only vessel left at Jamestown. The
anchor was actually raised when Smith hastily collected a force and
hurried to the landing. "With the hazzard of his life, with sakre,
falcon, and musket shot, Smith forced" (them) "now the third time to
stay or sinke."</p>

<p>In their sullen rage the foiled conspirators plotted and nearly
executed a fiendish revenge. Once more we copy from the "General
History," written by Smith and his friends.</p>

<p>"Some no better than they should be, had plotted with the president"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span> (Ratcliffe) "the next day to have put him" (Smith) "to death
by the Leviticall law for the lives of Robinson and Emry, pretending
the fault was his that had led them to their ends; but he quickly took
such order with such lawyers that he layd them by the heeles till he
sent some of them prisoners to England."</p>

<p>The colony was almost destitute of food, and the memories of the
famine of last year terrified the imaginations of those who had lived
through it. "Gentlemen" having again predominated in reinforcements
sent from England, the crops planted and gathered in Smith's absence
had been meagre, while rats brought over in one of the vessels had
wrought havoc with stored grain. Like an angel of mercy was the
apparition of Pocahontas, at the head of a "wild train" of Indians
laden with corn and game, approaching the fort. "Ever once in four or
five days during the time of two or three years," the young princess,
thus attended, visited the fort and succored the needy settlers. Smith
declares that "next under God she preserved the colony from death,
famine, and utter confusion." He might have subjoined that, but for
himself, not even Pocahontas's bounty could have saved the settlement
from the consequences of misconduct and misrule.</p>

<p>His was the only voice lifted to condemn the mad folly of loading a
homeward-bound vessel with the glittering mud of a neighboring creek.
That he was "not enamored of their dirty skill to freight such a
drunken ship with so much gilded dirt"&mdash;was one of the mildest of his
phrases, as, "breathing out these and many other passions," he
harangued those who had "no thought, no discourse, no hope, and no
work but to dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, and load gold."</p>

<p>Before the English assayers confirmed his judgment as to the value of
this cargo, the intrepid adventurer had sailed, with fourteen others,
up the Chesapeake into new and wonderful regions. Never losing heart,
even when he believed himself to be dying from the sting of a
poisonous fish, he discovered and entered the Potomac, the
Rappahannock, and tributary creeks, fighting his way when not allowed
to proceed peaceably. In July (1608) he led another party to the spot
now occupied by the city of Baltimore, and made friends with a tribe
called Susquehannocks, believed to be sun-worshippers. Returning from
these voyages of three thousand miles in all, he drew in masterly
style a chart of the countries explored, and sent it to England.</p>

<p>Jamestown was still in a state of what he calls "combustion," under
the tyranny of Ratcliffe. Emboldened by Smith's return, the colonists
deposed the hated governor, and formally elected Smith Governor of
Virginia. The winter closed in upon an "affrighted" population.
Storehouses were nearly empty, agriculture having been neglected in
the gold fever. As Smith could not be "persuaded to use" the gallows,
so he now announced that "no persuasion could persuade <i>him</i> to
starve." In company with George Percy and fifty others, he visited his
old ally Powhatan, and tried to buy food. A change had come to the
emperor's heart. He addressed his quondam armorer as a "rash youth;"
protested that he was afraid of him, and would not treat with the
English unless they came to him unarmed. Warned by Pocahontas, who
stole through the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> woods after dark to apprise Smith that
treachery was intended, the party lay on their arms all night, and the
force sent to surprise them retreated. Next day, Powhatan loaded the
boats with corn, and Smith sailed up the York upon a similar errand to
Opecancanough, Powhatan's brother. While in audience with him, the
Englishmen were surrounded by a band of seven hundred armed savages.
Seizing the wily chieftain by the scalp-lock, Smith held a pistol to
his breast, and demanded a cargo of corn and safe-conduct for his
party to Jamestown. The fifty men, without loss of a single life, took
back enough food to victual the town.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1609, the president thus made known his policy
to his constituents:</p>

<p>"Countrymen! You see now that power resteth wholly in myself. You must
obey this now for a law&mdash;<i>he that will not work shall not eat</i>. And
though you presume that authority here is but a shadow and that I dare
not touch the lives of any, but my own must answer for it, yet he that
offendeth, let him assuredly expect his due punishment.</p>

<p>"I protest by that God that made me, since necessity hath no power to
force you to gather for yourselves, you shall not only gather for
yourselves, but for those that are sick. <i>They</i> shall not starve."</p>

<p>Fields were tilled, the fort was repaired, wise Powhatan treated the
pale-faces kindly for Smith's sake, and the emigrants felt for the
first time firm ground beneath their feet. They had twenty-four pieces
of ordnance, and three hundred stand of small-arms; three ships, seven
boats, a store of more than two months' provisions, six hundred hogs,
with goats, fowls, and sheep, and an established trading-station with
the natives.</p>

<p>Like an aërolite from the summer sky came news from England that a
fleet was to be sent out with a new colony, a new charter, and new
officers; Smith's old enemy, Christopher Newport, was in command of
the expedition. Smith had been complained of at home as "dealing
harshly with the natives and not returning the ships full-freighted."
His day was over. The king so willed it.</p>

<p>Smith's last official act was the establishment of a colony at
Powhatan, renamed "Nonsuch," opposite where the city of Richmond was
laid out over a century later. On his way back to Jamestown, he was
cruelly wounded by the explosion of a bag of gunpowder. There was no
good surgeon in the colony. To return forthwith to England was but
anticipating by a few weeks what must be when the fleet arrived.</p>

<p>He returned to London at the age of thirty. "He had broke the ice and
beat the path, but had not there" (in Virginia) "one foot of ground,
nor the very house he builded, nor the ground he digged with his own
hands."</p>

<p>In 1614 he returned to America, but now to the northern region
assigned to the Plymouth Company. He gave name to Boston; explored and
made a survey of the New England coast. On a second voyage he had a
fight with a French squadron, was captured, and taken to Rochelle.
While there he wrote a "Description of New England," for which service
James I. appointed him <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> "Admiral of New England." He died in
London, in 1631, at the age of fifty-two, never having revisited
Virginia. Upon his tomb, in the Church of St. Sepulchre's, London, may
be still traced the outlines of the Three Turks' Heads and the
inscription, beginning:</p>

<p class="poem10">
  "<i>Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings.</i>"</p>

<p>Any sketch of his life, however brief, would be incomplete that
contained no reference to the letter written by him to Queen Anne (the
consort of James I.), in 1616, recommending the Lady Rebecca Rolfe to
the royal favor.</p>

<p>He would "be guilty of the deadly poison of ingratitude," he wrote, if
he failed to narrate what he and the colony at Jamestown owed to
Pocahontas. He besought the queen's kindly consideration for the
stranger just landed upon her shores, as due to Pocahontas's "great
spirit, her desert, birth, want, and simplicity." His one call upon
the wife of John Rolfe, Gentleman, was marked by profound respect on
his part to one whom he accosted as "Lady Rebecca;" by profound
emotion on hers.</p>

<p>John Smith's biography and epitaph are best summed up by one of his
brothers-in-arms:</p>

<p class="quote">
     "What shall I saye, but thus we lost him that in all his
     proceedings made justice his first guide and experience his
     second, ever hating basenesse, sloth, pride, and indignitie more
     than any dangers; that never allowed more for himself than for
     his soldiers with him; that upon no danger would send them where
     he would not lead them himselfe; that would never see us want
     what he either had or could by any means get us; that would
     rather want than borrow, or starve than not pay; that loved
     action more than wordes, and hated falsehood and covetousnesse
     worse than death; whose adventures were our lives and whose losse
     our deaths."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>WILLIAM HARVEY<br>

(1578-1657)</h3>


<p>William Harvey was born on April 1, 1578, at Folkestone, on the
southern coast of Kent. He was the eldest of nine children; of the
rest little more is known, than that several of the brothers were
among the most eminent merchants in the city of London during the
reigns of the two first Stuarts. His father, Thomas Harvey, followed
no profession. He married Joanna Falke, at the age of twenty, and
lived upon his own estate at Folkestone. This property devolved by
inheritance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span> upon his eldest son; and the greater part of it
was eventually bequeathed by him to the college at which he was
educated.</p>

<p>At ten years of age he commenced his studies at the grammar school in
Canterbury; and upon May 31, 1593, soon after the completion of his
fifteenth year, was admitted as a pensioner at Caius College,
Cambridge.</p>

<a id="img065" name="img065"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/img065.jpg" width="200" height="276" alt="William Harvey." title="">
</div>

<p>At that time a familiar acquaintance with logic and the learned
languages was indispensable as a first step in the prosecution of all
the branches of science, especially of medicine; and the skill with
which Harvey avails himself of the scholastic form of reasoning in his
great work on the Circulation, with the elegant Latin style of all his
writings, particularly of his latest work on the Generation of
Animals, affords a sufficient proof of his diligence in the
prosecution of these preliminary studies during the next four years
which he spent at Cambridge. The two next were occupied in visiting
the principal cities and seminaries of the Continent. He then prepared
to address himself to those investigations to which the rest of his
life was devoted; and the scene of his introduction to them could not
have been better chosen than at the University of Padua, where he
became a student in his twenty-second year.</p>

<p>The ancient physicians gathered what they knew of anatomy from
inaccurate dissections of the lower animals, and the slender knowledge
thus acquired, however inadequate to unfold the complicated functions
of the human frame, was abundantly sufficient as a basis for
conjecture, of which they took full advantage. With them everything
became easy to explain, precisely because nothing was understood; and
the nature and treatment of disease, the great object of medicine, and
its subsidiary sciences, was hardily abandoned to the conduct of the
imagination, and sought for literally among the stars. Nevertheless,
so firmly was their authority established, that even down to the close
of the sixteenth century the naturalists of Europe still continued to
derive all their physiology, and the greater part of their anatomy and
medicine, from the works of Aristotle and Galen, read not in the
original Greek, but re-translated into Latin from the interpolated
versions of the Arabian physicians. The opinions entertained by these
dictators in the republic of letters, and consequently by their
submissive followers, with regard to the structure and functions of
the organs concerned in the circulation, were particularly fanciful
and confused; so much so that it would be no easy task to give an
intelligible account of them that would not be tedious from its
length. It will be enough to say, that a scarcely more oppressive mass
of mischievous error was cleared away from the science of astronomy by
the discovery of Newton, than that from which physiology was
disencumbered by the discovery of Harvey.</p>

<p>But though the work was completed by an Englishman, it is to Italy
that, in anatomy, as in most of the sciences, we owe the first
attempts to cast off the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span> thralldom of the ancients. Mundinus
had published a work in the year 1315, which contained a few original
observations of his own; and his essay was so well received that it
remained the text-book of the Italian schools of anatomy for upward of
two centuries. It was enriched from time to time by various
annotators, among the chief of whom were Achillini, and Berengarius,
the first person who published anatomical plates. But the great
reformer of anatomy was Vesalius, who, born at Brussels in 1514, had
attained such early celebrity during his studies at Paris and Louvain,
that he was invited by the Republic of Venice, in his twenty-second
year, to the chair of anatomy at Padua, which he filled for seven
years with the highest reputation. He also taught at Bologna, and
subsequently, by the invitation of Cosmo de' Medici, at Pisa. The
first edition of his work, "De Corporis Humani Fabrica" was printed at
Basle, in the year 1543; it is perhaps one of the most successful
efforts of human industry and research, and from the date of its
publication begins an entirely new era in the science of which it
treats. The despotic sway hitherto maintained in the schools of
medicine by the writings of Aristotle and Galen was now shaken to its
foundation, and a new race of anatomists eagerly pressed forward in
the path of discovery. Among these no one was more conspicuous than
Fallopius, the disciple, successor, and in fame the rival, of
Vesalius, at Padua. After him the anatomical professorship was filled
by Fabricius ab Aquapendente, the last of the distinguished anatomists
who flourished at Padua in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Harvey became his pupil in 1599, and from this time he appears to have
applied himself seriously to the study of anatomy. The first germ of
the discovery which has shed immortal honor on his name and country
was conceived in the lecture-room of Fabricius.</p>

<p>He remained at Padua for two years; and having received the Degree of
Doctor of Arts and Medicine, with unusual marks of distinction,
returned to England early in the year 1602. Two years afterward he
commenced practice in London and married the daughter of Dr. Launcelot
Browne, by whom he had no children. He became a Fellow of the College
of Physicians, when about thirty years of age, having in the meantime
renewed his degree of Doctor in Medicine, at Cambridge; and was soon
after elected Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, which office he
retained till a late period of his life.</p>

<p>On August 4, 1615, he was appointed Reader of Anatomy and Surgery to
the College of Physicians. From some scattered hints in his writings
it appears that his doctrine of the circulation was first advanced in
his lectures at the college about four years afterward; and a
note-book in his own hand-writing is still preserved at the British
Museum, in which the principal arguments by which it is substantiated
are briefly set down, as if for reference in the lecture-room. Yet
with the characteristic caution and modesty of true genius, he
continued for nine years longer to reason and experimentalize upon
what is now considered one of the simplest, as it is undoubtedly the
most important known law of animal nature; and it was not till the
year 1628, the fifty-first of his life, that he consented to publish
his discovery to the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span> In that year the "Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et
Sanguinis" was published at Frankfort. This masterly treatise begins
with a short outline and refutation of the opinions of former
anatomists on the movement of the animal fluids and the function of
the heart; the author discriminating with care, and anxiously
acknowledging the glimpses of the truth to be met with in their
writings; as if he had not only kept in mind the justice due to
previous discoveries, and the prudence of softening the novelty and
veiling the extent of his own, but had foreseen the preposterous
imputation of plagiarism, which, with other inconsistent charges, was
afterward brought forward against him. This short sketch is followed
by a plain exposition of the anatomy of the circulation, and a detail
of the results of numerous experiments; and the new theory is finally
maintained in a strain of close and powerful reasoning, and followed
into some of its most important consequences. The whole argument is
conducted in simple and unpretending language, with great perspicuity,
and scrupulous attention to logical form.</p>

<p>The doctrine announced by Harvey may be briefly stated thus: The blood
circulates through the body, thereby sustaining life. The heart is
simply the pump which drives the blood through the arteries, from
whence it returns impure, and is then forced through the lungs and
repurified.</p>

<p>The pulmonary circulation had been surmised by Galen, and maintained
by his successors; but no proof even of this insulated portion of the
truth, more than amounted to strong probability, had been given till
the time of Harvey, and no plausible claim to the discovery, still
less to the demonstration, of the general circulation has ever been
set up in opposition to his. Indeed, its truth was quite inconsistent
with the ideas everywhere entertained in the schools on the functions
of the heart and other viscera, and was destructive of many favorite
theories. The new doctrine, therefore, as may well be supposed, was
received by most of the anatomists of the period with distrust, and by
all with surprise. Some of them undertook to refute it, but their
objections turned principally on the silence of Galen, or consisted of
the most frivolous cavils; the controversy, too, assumed the form of
personal abuse even more speedily than is usually the case when
authority is at issue with reason. To such opposition Harvey for some
time did not think it necessary to reply; but some of his friends in
England, and of the adherents to his doctrine on the Continent, warmly
took up his defence. At length he was induced to take a personal share
in the dispute in answer to Riolanus, a Parisian anatomist of some
celebrity, whose objections were distinguished by some show of
philosophy, and unusual abstinence from abuse. The answer was
conciliatory and complete, but ineffectual to produce conviction; and
in reply to Harvey's appeal to direct experiment, his opponent urged
nothing but conjecture and assertion. Harvey once more rejoined at a
considerable length; taking occasion to give a spirited rebuke to the
unworthy reception he had met with, in which it seems that Riolanus
had now permitted himself to join; adducing several new and conclusive
experiments in support of his theory; and entering at large upon its
value in simplifying physiology and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> the study of diseases,
with other interesting collateral topics. Riolanus, however, still
remained unconvinced; and his second rejoinder was treated by Harvey
with contemptuous silence. He had already exhausted the subject in the
two excellent controversial pieces just mentioned, the last of which
is said to have been written at Oxford about 1645; and he never
resumed the discussion in print. Time had now come to the assistance
of argument, and his discovery began to be generally admitted. To
this, indeed, his opponents contributed, by a still more singular
discovery of their own, namely, that the facts had been observed, and
the important inference drawn, long before. This was the mere
allegation of envy, chafed at the achievements of another, which, from
their apparent facility, might have been its own. It is indeed strange
that the simple mechanism thus explained should have been unobserved
or misunderstood so long; and nothing can account for it but the
imperceptible lightness as well as the strength of the chains which
authority imposes on the mind.</p>

<p>In the year 1623 Harvey became physician extraordinary to James I.,
and seven years later was appointed physician to Charles. He followed
the fortunes of that monarch, who treated him with great distinction
during the first years of the civil war, and he was present at the
battle of Edgehill, in 1642. Having been incorporated doctor of physic
by the University of Oxford, he was promoted by Charles to the
wardenship of Merton College, in 1645; but he did not retain this
office very long, his predecessor, Dr. Brent, being reinstated by the
Parliament after the surrender of Oxford in the following year.</p>

<p>Harvey then returned to London, and resided with his brother Eliat at
Cockaine house, in the Poultry. About the time of Charles's execution
he gave up his practice, which had never been considerable, probably
in consequence of his devotion to the scientific, rather than the
practical, parts of his profession. He himself, however, attributed
his want of success to the enmity excited by his discovery. After a
second visit to the Continent, he secluded himself in the country,
sometimes at his own house in Lambeth, and sometimes with his brother
Eliat at Combe, in Surrey. Here he was visited by his friend, Dr. Ent,
in 1651, by whom he was persuaded to allow the publication of his work
on the "Generation of Animals." It was the fruit of many years of
experiment and meditation; and, though the vehicle of no remarkable
discovery, is replete with interest and research, and contains
passages of brilliant and even poetical eloquence. The object of his
work is to trace the germ through all its changes to the period of
maturity; and the illustrations are principally drawn from the
phenomena exhibited by eggs in the process of incubation, which he
watched with great care, and has described with minuteness and
fidelity. The microscope had not at that time the perfection it has
since attained; and consequently Harvey's account of the first
appearance of the chick is somewhat inaccurate, and has been
superseded by the observations of Malpighi, Hunter, and others. The
experiments upon which he chiefly relied in this department of natural
history had been repeated in the presence of Charles I., who appears
to have taken great interest in the studies of his physician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span> In the year 1653, the seventy-fifth of his life, Harvey
presented the College of Physicians with the title-deed of a building
erected in their garden, and elegantly fitted up, at his expense, with
a library and museum, and commodious apartments for their social
meetings. Upon this occasion he resigned the professorship of anatomy,
which he had held for nearly forty years, and was succeeded by Dr.
Glisson.</p>

<p>In 1654 he was elected to the presidency of the college, which he
declined on the plea of age; and the former president, Sir Francis
Prujean, was re-elected at his request. Two years afterward he made a
donation to the college of a part of his patrimonial estate, to the
yearly value of £56, as a provision for the maintenance of the
library, and the annual festival and oration in commemoration of
benefactors.</p>

<p>At length his constitution, which had long been harassed by the gout,
yielded to the increasing infirmities of age, and he died in his
eightieth year, on June 3, 1657. He was buried at Hempstead, in Essex,
in a vault belonging to his brother Eliat, who was his principal heir,
and his remains were followed to the grave by a numerous procession of
the body of which he had been so illustrious and munificent a member.</p>

<p>In person he was below the middle size, but well proportioned. He had
a dark complexion, black hair, and small, lively eyes. In his youth
his temper is said to have been very hasty. If so, he was cured of
this defect as he grew older; for nothing can be more courteous and
temperate than his controversial writings; and the genuine kindness
and modesty which were conspicuous in all his dealings with others,
with his instructive conversation, gained him many attached and
excellent friends. He was fond of meditation and retirement; and there
is much in his works to characterize him as a man of warm and
unaffected piety.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>PRINCE CHARLES STUART<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13" title="Go to footnote 13"><span class="small">[13]</span></a><br>

By <span class="smcap">Andrew Lang, LL.D.</span><br>

(1720-1788)</h3>


<p>Charles Edward Stuart, called the "Young Pretender" by his enemies,
the "Young Chevalier" by neutrals, "Prince of Wales" and "Prince
Regent" by his partisans, "Prince Edouard" by the French, "Ned" by his
intimates, as we read in letters of Oliphant of Gask, and "Prince
Charlie" by later generations, was born at Rome, December 31, 1720.
His father was James VIII., of Scotland, and III. of England,
according to the Legitimist theory; his foes called him "The
Pretender," partly on the strength of the old fable about the
warming-pan, so useful to the Whigs. No sane person now doubts the
genuineness of James' descent from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> James II., but the
nickname of Pretender still sticks, though Boswell tells us that
George III. particularly disliked an appellation which "may be
parliamentary, but is not gentlemanly." James III., or the Chevalier
de St. George, was taken up by Louis XIV. on the death of James II.,
in France. He is said to have displayed courage in several battles in
Flanders, but his attempt to assert his rights in 1715 was a
melancholy failure. James showed melancholy and want of confidence; he
soon left Scotland for the Continent, and the best that can be said
for his conduct is that he endeavored to compensate the peasants whose
houses were destroyed in the military operations of "the Fifteen."
Unable to reside in France, he retired to Rome, a pensioner of the
Pope, and entertained with royal honors. In 1719 he married Clementina
Sobieski, a granddaughter of the famous John Sobieski, who delivered
Europe from the Turks. Their eldest son, Prince Charles, appears to
have inherited the spirit and daring of his Polish ancestors, which
animated him throughout his youth, and were extinguished less by
Culloden than by the treatment which he received from the French
court, by his imprisonment in Vincennes in 1748, and by the
unrelenting animosity of the English Government, which made him a
homeless exile living mysteriously in hiding on the Continent.
Heart-broken by these misfortunes and by other disappointments,
Charles developed an unreasoning and sullen obstinacy, which alienated
his adherents, while the habit of heavy drinking, learned in his
Highland distresses, ruined his head and heart, and converted the most
gallant, gay, and promising of princes into a brutal dipsomaniac.</p>

</div>

<p>The education of Charles was casual and interrupted. Now he was in the
hands of Protestants, now of Catholic governors and tutors, as the
advice of English adherents, or the wishes of his devout mother,
chanced to prevail. There were frequent quarrels between James and his
wife, turning partly on the question of education, more on the
jealousy which the queen conceived of the Countess of Inverness. The
Pope sided with the queen in these melancholy broils, and James's
private life (which was not faultless) was much more subject to
criticism and interference than that of his at least equally lax rival
on the English throne. A second son, Henry Benedict, Duke of York, was
born in 1725, and, at one time, was regarded as of more martial
disposition than Prince Charles. As the elder, Charles was first under
fire, and at the siege of Gaeta, in 1734, while a mere boy, he
displayed coolness, daring, and contempt of danger. Young Henry, aged
nine, "was so much discontented at being refused the partnership of
that glory and that danger, that he would not put on his sword till
his father threatened to take away his garter too," says Murray of
Broughton, in a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> letter dated 1742. In later life the Duke of
York showed no military aptitude. A kind of progress which Charles
made through the cities of Italy, aroused his desire to be a prince in
more than name. The English Government quarrelled with the Republic of
Venice about the royal honors paid to the prince, and his ambition was
awakened. His education, we have said, was very imperfect. Murray of
Broughton, indeed, credits him with Latin, Greek, history, and
philosophy. But his spelling in both French and English was unusually
bad, even in an age of free spelling; he wrote <i>époles</i> for <i>epaules</i>,
"Gems" for "James," "sord" for "sword." He did not neglect physical
exercise; was wont to make long marches without stockings, to harden
his feet (as he told a follower during his Highland distresses). He
was a good shot, fond of hunting, and, about 1742, was probably the
first man who ever played golf in Italy. Murray describes him as "tall
above the common stature, his limbs cast in the most exact mould, his
complexion of an uncommon delicacy, all his features perfectly regular
and well turned, and his eyes the finest I ever saw." Whether they
were blue or hazel is undecided; they are hazel in at least one
contemporary portrait. As a boy, engravings show him pretty, merry,
and buoyant; an air of melancholy may be remarked as early as 1744.
With bright nut-brown hair, golden in the sun, and worn long beneath
his peruke, he certainly justified the endearing name of "Bonny Prince
Charlie." The distinction of his air could be concealed by no
disguise, as his followers loved fondly to declare. He certainly had
the royal memory for faces. At the opera, in 1773, he noticed an
English officer opposite, whom he sent for. The gentleman visited the
royal box, accompanied by a Scotch servant. "I have seen you before,"
said Charles to this man. "You once brought me a message at Falkirk,
in 1746."</p>

<p>Such was Prince Charles when, in 1742, Murray of Broughton became
acquainted with the royal exile in Rome, and was appointed secretary
for Scotland. With Lochiel and others, Murray formed a Jacobite
association in his native country. Negotiations were begun with the
French court, which hung off and on, as did the English Jacobites.
They would rise, if France supplied men, money, and arms. France would
do this if sufficiently assured of support in England. The king had no
enthusiasm for the enterprise. He was weary of promises and of leaning
on that broken reed, Louis XV. Murray intrigued in Scotland, Lord
Elcho in England, Kelly at the French court. Lord Semple confused all
by false hopes; Charles was much in the hands of Irishmen&mdash;Sheridan,
Sullivan, O'Brien, and O'Neil; already a "forward," or Prince's party
was growing, as opposed to the waiting policy and party of the
disheartened and unambitious James. To what extent English Jacobites
were pledged is uncertain. There was much discontent with the
Hanoverian dynasty in England, but the dread of popery was strong
among the middle classes. The butchers were advised that Catholics ate
no meat on Sundays, the official clergy preached Protestant sermons,
the Jacobite gentry feared for their lives and estates in case of
failure, and the sagacity of the Government has never revealed the
extent to which the Duke of Beaufort and others were committed to King
James. The universities, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> the sporting squires, and the
smugglers drank to "The king over the water," but there enthusiasm
began and ended.</p>

<p>More was expected, and till assured of more, France held aloof, while
making promises enough. Even the Highland chiefs said that without a
French army nothing could be done. In 1744 Charles left Rome, under
pretext of a hunting party, concealed his withdrawal with great skill,
and reached Paris. He was obliged, however, to be incognito and was
not received by the king. An invading force was crowded on board ship.
The chance seemed excellent, England's forces being mainly abroad; but
the old friends of England, the winds, drove the battered fleet back
into harbor, and Charles in vain tried to persuade the Earl Marischal
to accompany him to Scotland in a small fishing vessel.</p>

<p>One result followed the reception of Charles by France, niggardly as
that reception was&mdash;war with England broke out, and the French army of
invasion was moved from Dunkirk to Flanders. The prince, not permitted
to serve in the French army, returned to Paris, where he had been
falsely assured by Semple and Æneas Macdonald that England was ready
to rise for him. Murray, who visited him in Paris, tried to dissuade
him from a wild venture; in Scotland he found the chiefs of his own
opinion, but the letter carrying the news never reached the prince.
His Irish friends urged him on; "the expedition was entirely an Irish
project." He borrowed money from his bankers, the Waters, he pawned
his share of the Sobieski jewels, and, with a privateer man-of-war and
a brig, La Doutelle, he left Belleisle on July 13, 1745. Neither the
French court nor his father knew that, attended only by seven men,
"The Seven Men of Moidart," he had set out to seek for a crown. The
day before he embarked he wrote to James; he said that no man would
buy a horse, nor trust a prince, that showed no spirit. "I never
intend to come back," he added. So, dressed as a student of the Scots
College, he started. He lost his convoy, the Elizabeth, on the way,
after a drawn battle with the Lion (Captain Brett). Resisting all
advice to turn back, as Æneas Macdonald, who accompanied him,
narrates, he held on in La Doutelle, and reached Erisca, an islet
between Barra and South Uist, on August 2, 1745. An eagle hovered over
his ship, and Tullibardine hailed the royal bird as a happy omen. But
he found himself unwelcome. Boisdale bade him go home; "I <i>am</i> at
home," said the prince. He steered for Moidart, the most beautiful but
the wildest shore of Scotland, a region of steep and serrated
mountains, of long salt-water straits, winding beneath the bases of
the hills, and of great fresh-water lochs. Loch Nahuagh was his port;
here he received Clan Ranald, whose desolate keep, Castle Tirrim,
stands yet in ruins, since "the Fifteen." Glenaladale (whose
descendants yet hold their barren acres), Dalilea, and Kinlochmoidart
(now, like Clan Ranald, landless men) met him with discouraging words.
But, seeing a flash in the eyes of a young Macdonald, of
Kinlochmoidart, Charles said, "You will not forsake me?" "I will
follow you to death, were no other sword drawn in your cause."</p>

<p>The chiefs caught fire, Charles landed, with the seven men of
Moidart&mdash;Æneas Macdonald, the Judas of the cause; the Duke of Athol
(Tullibardine), <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span> who had been out in the fifteen; Sheridan,
the prince's tutor; Sir John Macdonald; Kelley, a parson who had been
in Atterbury's affair; Strickland, an Englishman; and Buchanan. Young
Lochiel was disinclined to join, but yielded to the fascination of the
prince. With his accession the rising was a certainty. But Duncan
Forbes of Culloden, the lord president, had influence enough to hold
back the Macleods of Skye, to paralyze the shifty Lovat, and to secure
the Sutherland house for the Hanoverian cause. Charles left Boisdale
for Kinlochmoidart, "the head of Loch Moidart," where an avenue of
trees, the prince's walk, is still shown, though the old house was
burned after Culloden. Keppoch cut off a small party of Scots Royal;
this was first blood for the Jacobite cause. The wounded were
hospitably treated by Lochiel; the English captain was released on
parole. Charles now crossed the steep hills between Kinlochmoidart and
the long narrow lake of Loch Sheil, there he took boat, and rowed past
the lands of Glenaladale and Dalilea to Glenfinnan, where Tullibardine
raised the standard, inscribed <i>Tandem Triumphans</i>. A statue of the
prince, gazing southward, now marks the spot. The clans came in, and
as Charles marched southeast, each glen sent down its warriors to join
the stream. The clansmen, as a rule, had probably little knowledge of
or interest in the cause. They followed their chiefs. The surviving
Gaelic poetry speaks much of the chieftains; of <i>Tearlach, righ nan
Gael</i>, but little is said. It was the middle of August before the
rulers of England received the news of the landing. They at once set a
reward of £30,000 on Charles's head, a proceeding "unusual among
Christian princes," said Charles, who was compelled by his forces, and
their threats of desertion, to follow the evil example. Sir John Cope
was sent with an English army to stop the prince. It appeared likely
that the armies would meet about Dalwhinnie, now the highest and
bleakest part of the Highland Railway. The path then led over
Corryarrack; Charles and his men raced for the summit, but Cope was
not to be seen. He had marched east and north, to Inverness, and all
the south of Scotland lay open to the prince. He passed by
Killiecrankie and Blair Athol to Perth; Cluny came in, with the Duke
of Perth, and Lord George Murray, Charles's most skilled general, who
had been out at Glensheil, in 1719, and had learned the lesson of war
in the Sardinian army. How easily he won Edinburgh, how he held court
at Holyrood, how he routed Cope (who returned by sea) at Preston Pans
or Gladsmuir, is familiar to all. His clemency was conspicuous; he
wrote to James that he would give up Holyrood to the wounded, rather
than see them homeless. Home, a Whig volunteer, and the author of a
Whiggish history, acknowledges the nobility of his conduct, and his
"foolish lenity" (he would not permit the execution of several persons
who tried to assassinate him) is blamed by the fanatics who, in 1749,
issued a wild Cameronian manifesto, "The Active Testimonies of
Presbyterians." The contrast with the savage brutalities of Cumberland
is very notable. In the battle the chiefs refused to let Charles lead
the charge, but he was at the head of the second line, "a pistol shot
behind" the first. Preston Pans was fought on September 21, 1745. That
Charles dallied before Edinburgh Castle till October 21st <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span>
was no fault of his. Some of his men had gone home with booty, others
were to be waited for, many of the chiefs were in favor of holding
Scotland under James as a separate kingdom, and it was only by
constant personal appeals that the prince persuaded them to push
south. Lord George's strategy deceived the English, who knew not where
to look for the Highlanders. They met at Carlisle, took it, passed
through Preston and Manchester, gave Cumberland the slip, and their
advanced posts, six miles south of Derby, were within a hundred and
twenty miles of London. The army of Finchley was unlikely to make a
stand, the city was partly Jacobite, the mob were ready for anything,
when Lord George and the chiefs insisted on retreat. Historians doubt
which policy was the wiser; it is certain that success, if to be
attained at all, could only be won by audacity. The chiefs, however,
declared for a return and a junction with French forces then expected.
Charles wept and prayed to no avail. His army, as disappointed as
himself, found their faces set to the north, and the prince, who had
ever walked among the first ranks, leaving his carriage to old Lord
Pitsligo, now rode dejected and heart-broken. The retreat was rapid
and able. At Clifton, Murray turned on the pursuing dragoons, headed a
claymore charge, and drove them back. A hapless garrison of Lancashire
volunteers was left to the tender mercies of Cumberland in Carlisle,
and Charles went by way of Whiggish Dumfries (the house where he
lodged is now an inn) to Glasgow. To all intents and purposes the end
had come. Charles had lost faith in the advisers who dragged him back
from the south, he listened to Murray of Broughton and to his Irishry;
he suspected, unjustly but not unnaturally, the good faith of Lord
George. He dallied at Stirling, besieging the castle without proper
artillery, and Hawley was sent to attack him. On January 17, 1746, the
armies met at Falkirk. A storm of wind and rain blew at the backs of
the Highlanders, they charged, scattered the enemy, drove them in
flight, and cut up the Glasgow volunteers. But, in the dark and the
mist they scarcely knew their own advantage. The pipers had thrown
their pipes to their boys, had gone in with the claymore, and could
not sound the calls. Hawley wrote to Cumberland "My heart is broke ...
I got off but three cannon of the ten." Hawley retreated to Edinburgh,
the Duke of Cumberland came to take the command; the Highlanders began
to desert with their booty, dissensions prevailed, and Charles went on
besieging Stirling. Again Lord George Murray urged a retreat, Charles
dashed his head in impotent rage against the wall of his room, but he
had to follow. With perfect truth he said:</p>

<p>"I cannot see anything but ruin and destruction to us all in case we
should think of a retreat;" his forces in flight would lose heart, his
enemies would gain confidence. All this was true, but all this was
unavailing. Months were spent in unimportant movements. Cumberland,
meanwhile, instructed his men in the method of meeting a Highland
charge, and deceiving the parry of the Highland shields. It was known
that France would lend no substantial aid, and a French subsidy of
30,000 <i>Louis d'or</i> came too late, after the battle of Culloden, and
was buried at the head of Loch Arkaig. One last chance Charles had:
Lord <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span> George proposed, and Charles eagerly seconded, a night
surprise at Nairn. But the delays on the march, and the arrival of
dawn, made Murray command a retreat, and Charles's faith in him was
irretrievably gone for the time, though he later expressed in writing
a more worthy opinion. With 10,000 well-fed men against 5,000 who were
starving, Cumberland had every chance of victory at Culloden. The
Macdonalds, placed on the left wing, would not charge. Keppoch's men
were discontented because they were not allowed to have a Catholic
chaplain. Crying out, "The children of my clan have forsaken me,"
Keppoch charged alone, and died the death of renown. Beaten and
blinded by a storm of snow in their faces, the Highland right clove
the ranks of Monro and Burrell, only to fall, in layers three or four
deep, before the fire of Sempill's regiment in the second line. The
whole English force advanced; Charles rode to his second line, and
offered to charge with them. His officers told him that it was in
vain; Highlanders once beaten would not rally. (MS. "Lyon in
Mourning," and MS. of Stuart Threipland at Abbotsford.) Charles was
hurried off the field by his Irish tutor, and fled to Lord Lovat's, at
Gortuleg. A story of his lack of courage, told by Sir Walter Scott on
the authority of Sir James Stewart Denham's recollections of Lord
Elcho's MS., is erroneous. Lord Elcho's MS. does not contain the
statement. What he objects to is Charles's refusal to meet the
fragments of his army at Ruthven, in Badenoch, whence they hoped to
wage a guerilla warfare. Lord George Murray himself admits that the
project was impossible. Charles, however, should have gone to Ruthven,
but he distrusted Lord George; and his hope of a speedy voyage to
France, where he expected to receive aid in men and money, was
frustrated.</p>

<p>It is needless to repeat the tale of Cumberland's almost incredible
butcheries, cruelties, and robberies, or to tell of the executions
accompanied by the torture of disembowelling the living man. The story
of Charles's wanderings and distresses is narrated best in the MS.
"Lyon in Mourning," partly printed by Robert Chambers, in "Jacobite
Memoirs." No words can overpraise the loyalty of the starving
Highlanders; neither English tortures, nor the promise of £30,000,
ever moved one man or woman from their constant faith. Only one hungry
boy whom Charles had fed, attempted to betray him, but was not
believed. As for the prince, he is briefly described by a companion as
"the most prudent man not to be a coward, the most daring not to be
foolhardy, whom he had ever known." He showed a constant gayety,
singing and telling tales to hearten his followers. His resource was
endless; he was by far the best cook and the least fastidious eater of
his company. He could cook a dish of cow's brains, or swallow raw
oatmeal and salt-water. Surrounded by English <i>cordons</i>, through which
he slipped at night up the bed of a burn, when the sentinels had
reached their furthest point apart, Charles led a little expedition
which cut off the cattle intended for the provender of his enemies.
(MS. "Lyon in Mourning.") He would not even let a companion carry his
great-coat. He knew every extremity of hunger, thirst, and cold; and
perhaps his most miserable experience was to lurk for many hours,
devoured by midges, under a wet rock. Unshorn, unwashed, in a filthy
shirt, his last, he was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> yet the courteous prince in his
dealings with all women whom he met, notably with Flora Macdonald, the
stainless and courageous heroine of loyalty and womanly kindness. At
last, late in September, 1746, Charles, with Lochiel and many others,
escaped in a French barque from Loch Nahuagh, where he had first
landed. It has been said of him by his enemies, especially by Dr.
King, a renegade, that he was avaricious and ungrateful. Letters and
receipts in the muniment room of a Highland chief show him directing
large sums, probably out of the Loch Arkaig treasure, to be paid to
Lochiel, to "Keppoch's lady," and to many poor clansmen. The receipts,
written in hiding, and dried with snuff or sand, attest that the money
came to the persons for whom it was intended.</p>

<p>Charles' expedition could only be justified by success. That it failed
was due to no want of courage, or audacity, or resolve on his part,
but to the very nature of a Highland army, to the jealousies of Irish
and Scotch, to the half-heartedness of his English partisans, and to
the English horror of his father's religion. By his own creed he held
very loosely.</p>

<p>The First Meeting of Prince Charles with Flora Macdonald.</p></div>

<p>In France Charles was a popular hero, and adored by ladies. His
appearance at court was magnificent, and for him the Princesse de
Tallemant made every sacrifice. But the Government was deaf to his
appeals, a journey to Spain was fruitless; worst of all, his brother
Henry, to whom he had been tenderly devoted, accepted a cardinal's
hat, on July 3, 1747. This was fatal. The English would never forgive
a son of their so-called king who became a Romish priest; and the
shadow of the hat fell on Charles. From letters of James to the
prince, it is plain that, for some reason, the Duke of York could not
look forward to marriage and to continuing the Stuart family. The
young man, therefore, having also a vocation withal, accepted
ecclesiastical rank, and a cluster of rich benefices. A breach between
Charles and James followed, which was never healed, despite the
touching letters of the king to his "dearest Carluccio." Charles
betook himself to adventurous and secret projects. In the Highlands he
had learned to seek the consolation of the poor, and to forget hunger,
cold, misery, and sorrow in drink. He drank "our best bowlsman," says
an islander, under the table. The habit soon dominated him, and&mdash;with
his disgraceful arrest and imprisonment, when he refused to
acknowledge the peace of Aix la Chapelle and to withdraw from
France&mdash;soured his character and ruined his life. Released from
Vincennes, he hurried to the then Papal city of Avignon, where he
introduced boxing-matches. England threatened to bombard Civita
Vecchia, and Charles had to depart. Whither he went no man knows.
There is a Jacobite tract of 1750, purporting to be written by his
equerry, Henry Goring. According to this, Charles, Goring, and a
mysterious Comte de la Luze (Marshal Keith?), went to Lyons, Dijon,
Strasbourg. Here Charles rescued a beautiful girl from a fire, and
honorably declined to take advantage of her manifest passion for her
preserver. The party was attacked by assassins, Charles shot two of
them, La Luze and Goring accounted for others. They took ship from
some northern coast, were tempest-driven to an unfriendly port,
visited, apparently, Frederick the Great, spent some time in
Lithuania, and there are hints of a love affair, though Charles had
already <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> proclaimed that he would never marry to beget
royal beggars. He certainly visited Sweden; there was talk of him as a
candidate for the Polish crown. For many years (1749-1755) neither
James nor the English Government knew where Charles really was. Grimm
says that for three years he lay hidden in the house of a lady in
Paris, a friend of the Princesse de Tallemant. A sportsman and a lover
of the open air is not likely to have loitered so long with Armida in
a secret chamber. There is tattle about him in D'Argenson's "Memoirs;"
a disguised shabby prince appears now and then, none knows whence, and
vanishes. In the papers of Charles Stuart, Comte d'Albanie, one finds
a trace of a visit paid by the prince to Ireland. There is evidence,
in the State Papers, that he was not far from Paris, in June, 1749. We
have it under his own hand, in the Stuart Papers at Windsor, that he
visited London on September 5, 1750, returning to Paris on September
13th. Here, as we know from the document left by Archibald Cameron,
Lochiel's brother, the last man executed for the rising, or rather for
a later plot, Charles renounced the Catholic faith. Charles himself
gives 1750 as the date of this conversion. It came five years too
late, and he recanted his recantation. He was in England again later
(1752), and held his last council in Merriworth Castle in Kent. There
is a legend of his ghost haunting a house in Godalming, which probably
comes from a tradition of his residence there. Since 1750 or
thereabouts, a Miss Clementina Walkinshaw, of Barrowfield, had been
his mistress. He is said to have met her near Glasgow, and flirted
with her; when or where she fled to him on the continent is obscure.
Mr. Ewald supposes her to have been with him in Paris before the
affair of Vincennes (1748). The writer, however, has seen a letter
from Paris to a sister of Miss Walkinshaw describing the arrest at the
Opera House, without the most distant allusion to Clementina, about
whom her sister would be concerned. Clementina, judging by a
miniature, was a lady with very large black eyes; a portrait in oil
gives a less favorable view of her charms. In 1754 Charles was again
in England, and in Nottingham. He actually walked in Hyde Park, where
someone, recognizing him, tried to kneel to him. He therefore returned
at once to France. He is reported to have come back in 1755 or 1756,
braving the reward of £30,000 for his head. The Jacobites now
requested him to dismiss Clementina Walkinshaw, whose eldest sister
was a lady housekeeper in the Hanoverian family. A scrap in Charles's
hand at Windsor proves that he regarded some lady as a possible
traitor, but he declined to be dictated to, in his household matters,
by his adherents. This gave the English Jacobites an excuse for
turning their coats, of which they availed themselves. Sir Walter
Scott makes the romance of "Redgauntlet" hang on the incident. About
this time jottings of Charles prove that he fancied himself a
Republican. He hated Louis XV., and declined on one occasion to act as
a bug-bear (<i>épouvantail</i>), at the request of France. He had already
struck a medal in honor of the British Navy and contempt of the
French. He is now lost sight of till 1760, when Miss Walkinshaw, with
his daughter, left his protection for that of a convent. This lady, in
some letters, now unluckily lost, endeavored to persuade her family
that she was married to the prince. A later myth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span> averred
that her daughter (the Duchess of Albany) had been secretly married,
and a General Stuart, claiming, on this evidence, to be a legitimate
descendant of the prince, died about 1852. As Charles, late in life,
legitimatized his daughter by Clementina Walkinshaw (a thing needless
had he been married to her mother), and made affirmation that he never
had any other child, all these legends are manifestly absurd. (The
affirmation is among documents in possession of Lord Braye, and is
published by the Historical MSS. Commission.)</p>

<p>From this point there is little historical or personal interest in the
life of Charles. His father, James III., died in 1766, and was buried
as a king. Charles hurried from Bouillon to Rome; his brother, the
cardinal, tried to secure his recognition by the Papal Court, but the
Pope dared not, and no other government chose to defy the English
Ministry. Charles's life was spent, now in seclusion, now in society;
he still was fond of shooting, of music, and the drama; he still
retained his grace of demeanor when he happened to be sober. Late in
1771 he went in disguise to Paris, where he accepted a pension from
France, and a beautiful bride, Louise, Princess of Stolberg, descended
from the Earl of Ailesbury into whose arms Charles II. fell under the
stroke of his fatal illness. The ill-matched pair were married on Good
Friday, April 17, 1772. At first Charles behaved with more sobriety
and good humor than usual. A child of the marriage was expected, at
least by the Scotch Jacobites, in 1773. There is a legend that a child
was actually born, was intrusted to Captain John Carter Allen, was
brought up by him as his own, and this infant, grown to manhood,
became the father of two gentlemen calling themselves John Sobieski
Stolberg Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart, Counts of Albany. They
lived till late in the present century, were picturesque figures in
society, and writers of some spirit and vigor. For long they were much
cherished by some noble Highland families. Charles, the younger, has
left descendants. It is needless to discuss here the authenticity of
these claims.</p>

<p>Charles's relations with his wife were on the pattern of his relations
with his mistress. He was jealous, and brutal beyond description; she
was courted by Alfieri, the poet, and, after fleeing from her husband
to a convent, she united her fortunes with Alfieri's. On his death she
chose a young French painter, Fabre, as his successor, and to him she
left her rich collection of relics, spoils of the poet and the king. A
beautiful, witty, and engaging woman, she was long a centre of society
in Italy. She died in 1824. In 1784 Charles sent for his daughter by
Miss Walkinshaw. Both had long been maintained by the cardinal. He
made her Duchess of Albany, medals were designed, if never struck,
representing her as <i>spes ultima et exigua</i>, "the last frail hope," of
the Stuarts. For the last time, in conversation with a Mr. Greathead,
the old spirit blazed out. His face brightened, he began the tale of
his campaign, but, when attempting to narrate the butcheries of
Cumberland, the cruel executions in London, he fell on the floor in
convulsions. He used to solace himself by playing on the pipes, and at
the sound of the martial music which he had heard on three stricken
fields, he was able to live in the past. On January 31, 1788, the
anniversary of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span> the death of Charles I., Charles Edward
passed away from earth. His daughter did not long survive him; she was
killed by a fall from her horse. Henry now took the title of Henry IX.
"by grace of God, not by the will of men." He died in 1806; the French
had stripped him of all his property, even the famous Sobieski rubies
were gone, and he was in receipt of a pension from the English
Government. In 1819 George IV. erected a monument by Canova, in St
Peters at Rome, to "James III., son of James II., King of Great
Britain, to Charles Edward, and Henry, his sons, the last of the Royal
Stuart line. Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord." Sir Walter
Scott visited this alone of Roman sights, in 1832, just before he came
home to die.</p>

<p>Had Charles fallen at Culloden, history could find no blot on his
name, no stain on the white rose. Surviving, as he did, a
broken-hearted exile, with no home, no chance of a career, "eating his
own heart, shunning the paths of men," as Homer says of Bellerophon,
he fell a victim to the habit which has ever the same wretched
results, which turns a hero to a coward, a gentleman to a brute. Yet,
in his one year of brilliance, he won immortal love. Scott had seen
strong men, the prince's ancient comrades, weep at the mention of his
name. No man, in any age, ever inspired such a large, such a gallant,
such a tender and melancholy body of song. Even now as one hears the
notes of</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "Will ye no come back again,<br>
  Better lo'ed ye canna be,"</p>

<p class="noindent">sung by the lads of a Scotch village, one feels that Charles Stuart
did not wholly fail; the song outlives the dynasty, and relics of
Prince Charlie are fondly cherished, while no man cares a halfpenny
for his Hanoverian rivals.</p>

<p>The best life of Prince Charles is that by Mr. Ewald (London, 1875).
Mr. Ewald alone has used the State Papers at the Record Office. Lord
Stanhope's and Mr. Chambers's "Histories of the Forty-five" are also
excellent; as are "Jacobite Memoirs," selected from Bishop Forbes's
MS. "Lyon in Mourning." These works, with the contemporary tracts, and
some MSS., with Lord Stanhope's "Decline of the Last Stuarts," and the
Stuart Papers at Windsor, as given in Browne's "History of the
Highland Clans," have been consulted in compiling this study of Prince
Charles.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>As an example of the self-made man without fortune or the prestige of
a distinguished family to assist him, perhaps there is none better and
more instructive than the career of Captain Cook, the great English
navigator and discoverer. At his birth, in 1728, his father was a
farm-laborer, and his mother belonged to the same grade of society.
They lived in the north of England, and were people of excellent
character. On account of his honesty, industry, and skill in farming,
his father was promoted to the place of head servant on a farm some
distance from where he had been working; but it does not appear that
he ever made any further advancement. James learned to read and write,
and was instructed in some of the simpler rules of arithmetic, which
was the extent of his school learning, a very slender outfit for one
of the distinction to which he attained in a lifetime of fifty years.</p>

<p>At the age of thirteen James was bound as an apprentice to a dry-goods
dealer in a small way in a considerable fishing town. The business did
not suit the youth at all, for he had before cherished the idea of
going to sea, and his surroundings in a seaport doubtless increased
his yearnings in that direction. A disagreement between the apprentice
and his employer enabled him to procure his discharge, and he engaged
his services to the Messrs. Walker, a couple of Quakers, who owned two
vessels employed in the coal trade. He passed the greater portion of
his term, and a considerable period after its expiration, as a common
sailor on board of the ship Free Love, where he obtained a thorough
knowledge of seamanship. From this humble sphere he was promoted to be
mate of one of the Walker ships. His life in this capacity was
uneventful, though he was all the time learning navigation and storing
his mind with the information which was to enable him to distinguish
himself in later years.</p>

<p>In 1755, when Cook was twenty-seven years old, war broke out between
England and France, and there was a great demand for seamen for the
navy of England. At that time the system of impressment was in vogue,
and when Britain wanted sailors she took them, wherever and whenever
she could find them. Press-gangs were sent out, under one or more
officers, by ships of war in port needing more men. They visited the
drinking-places and taverns of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span> town and captured all the
seamen they could find, usually more or less intoxicated, and
compelled them to go on board of the man-of-war. They were forced to
do duty. Sometimes the unlucky tars were taken from the vessels to
which they belonged, whether in port or at sea. This impressment was
not always confined to British seamen, and this system was one of the
causes which led to the war of 1812 between England and the United
States. Though the law sanctioning this abuse was never repealed,
press-gangs became obsolete half a century ago.</p>

<p>Cook's ship was in the Thames at this time, and he was liable to
impressment, for mates were not exempt, though captains were. Like all
British seamen, he had a dread of being forced into the naval service,
oftener because they were forced than for any other reason. He
concealed himself, and used all the precautions he could to avoid such
a calamity, as he then regarded it. But he faithfully reconsidered the
subject, and concluded to enter the navy by voluntary enlistment, thus
escaping impressment, which would be an outrage upon his manhood. He
began his service on board the Eagle, a sixty-gun ship, which was soon
after commanded by Captain Palliser. Cook was not only an able and
skilful seaman, but he diligently and faithfully performed every duty,
so that he soon attracted the attention of his officers.</p>

<p>His friends at home had endeavored to do something for him, and his
commander received a letter from a member of Parliament commending the
seaman to his favor. The captain acknowledged the merit of Cook in his
reply, but stated that he had been in the navy for so brief a period
that he could not be made a commissioned officer, but in due time, if
he proved worthy, a master's warrant might be obtained for him. Four
years after he entered the service a strong interest secured this
promotion for him. In this capacity he was assigned to the frigate
Mercury, which was ordered to North America, where she became one of
the fleet that operated in connection with the army of General Wolfe
in the siege of Quebec.</p>

<p>The navigation of this portion of the St. Lawrence River was difficult
and dangerous then to the English; they were comparative strangers
there, and the French had removed the channel buoys. It was necessary
to make a survey, and Captain Palliser recommended Master Cook for the
service. The locality was exposed to the enemy, and for several nights
he conducted the work till he had about completed it, when his
operations were discovered by the French. A force of Indians was sent
to capture the surveyor, and they surrounded him in the darkness in
their canoes, and Cook made his escape only by leaping ashore, to
which his barge had been directed, near the English hospital, while
the Indians were boarding the boat over the stern. But he had
performed the duty intrusted to him, and from his measurements
constructed a perfect chart of the channel.</p>

<p>He was a very skilful draughtsman, though he had educated himself in
the art, as well as an expert surveyor, and he was employed by the
admiral in making surveys of other portions of the river. His charts
of the locality were published, with soundings and sailing directions;
and they were so correct that no <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> others were needed for at
least a hundred years. He piloted the boats of the squadron in the
attack upon Montmorency, and superintended the landing of the troops
for the assault on the Plains of Abraham, where both Wolfe and
Montcalm were mortally wounded.</p>

<p>For four years Cook had been an acting master, but in 1759 he was
fully confirmed in his rank and appointed to the flag-ship of Lord
Colvill, passing the following winter at Halifax. This was a season of
leisure from active professional occupation, and the master employed
it in studying geometry, astronomy, and mathematics generally, fitting
himself for the highest positions in the navy. For the next ten years
he was largely engaged in surveying in Newfoundland, and was present
at its capture from the French. Returning to England he was married,
but was soon sent back to the field of his recent labors, as marine
surveyor of the coasts, by the influence of his constant friend, now
Sir Hugh Palliser. He was busily employed in this capacity, rendering
valuable service to his country, and especially to the king's
ministers in arranging the terms of peace with France. During his
absence he observed an eclipse of the sun, which was so well done that
his results were published in the "Philosophical Transactions," adding
greatly to his reputation as an astronomer.</p>

<p>At this period the spirit of discovery was reanimated in England, and
an expedition was fitted out, at the instance of the Royal Society,
primarily to observe a transit of Venus across the disk of the sun,
which could only be done in some parts of the Pacific Ocean. Sir Hugh
Palliser was again his friend, and Cook, raised to the rank of
lieutenant, was appointed to the command. He selected a ship of three
hundred and seventy tons, called the Endeavor, for the purpose, and
accompanied by several eminent scientists, he sailed in 1778. In
addition to its astronomical task, the expedition was to make
discoveries and explorations in the Pacific.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to follow Lieutenant Cook in the details of his
three notable voyages of discovery in anything less than a volume, so
full are they of interesting incidents. He proceeded first to Madeira,
and then across the Atlantic to Rio Janeiro, where he made a
considerable stay to obtain supplies, and improve the condition of his
crew. Passing through the Strait of Le Maire, he went around Cape
Horn, and in April of 1769 the Endeavor arrived at Otaheite, now
called Tahiti, in the Society Islands, where the transit was to be
observed. The observations required a considerable stay in Matavia
Bay, and as soon as he had made his preparations on shore for the
work, the commander established regulations for intercourse between
his people and the natives who crowded in multitudes around their
strange visitors.</p>

<p>No man in his day and generation ever had more extensive dealings with
the uncivilized tribes of the earth than Captain Cook, and none ever
treated them with more enlightened humanity, or with more even-handed
justice. His treatment of the aborigines of the vast number of islands
and other regions he visited, is in remarkable contrast with that of
the early explorers of the Western Continent. By the latter the
natives were remorselessly slain, enslaved, and even tortured.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> They were regarded as pagans, with no natural rights, whose
territories, families, and persons were the legitimate spoils of the
conquerors. On the contrary, Cook, with the means in his possession to
overawe, subdue, and subjugate them, always extended to them the
utmost consideration in his power. He could be severe when necessity
required, but his forbearance was almost unlimited.</p>

<p>The first of a series of rules he established and enforced was: "To
endeavor, by every fair means, to cultivate a friendship with the
natives, and to treat them with all imaginable humanity." He was
largely dependent upon the resources of the islands he visited for the
sustenance of his people; but nothing, except in dire necessity, was
ever taken from the natives by force. Persons were appointed to trade
with them, and no others were allowed to barter or exchange goods with
them, and a proper equivalent was always to be given. His own men were
put under the strictest discipline in order to control their relations
with the natives who constantly surrounded them. Generally the most
friendly spirit prevailed on both sides. The inhabitants of all the
islands seemed to have a natural inclination to steal, and most of the
trouble with them grew out of this tendency. Cook judiciously
repressed theft from the beginning, and almost invariably compelled
the restoration of the property.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his own men were sometimes tempted to desert; but
he hunted them down, secured one or more chiefs as hostages, or by
some common-sense method recovered the absentees. At some of the
islands Cook was extremely popular with the inhabitants, and was
regarded as a superior being, even a demigod, in many of them. When he
was compelled to resort to extreme severity, he did not begin with
cannon, loaded with grape, but trusted first to the loud report,
terrific to the savages, fired over their heads, or had the muskets
loaded with small shot which would hurt, but did not kill. No
slaughter that could possibly be avoided was permitted. If he erred at
all it was on the side of humanity, and if he had been less forbearing
he might have added more years to his length of days.</p>

<p>The astronomical work at Otaheite was successfully accomplished, and
in July Captain Cook departed, taking with him Tupia, a native of some
distinction, who proved to be valuable to him as an interpreter, and
for his general knowledge. During this voyage he visited many of the
islands of the Pacific, including New Zealand, where he encountered no
little hostility, so that it was often difficult and sometimes
impossible to establish friendly relations with the natives. But he
obtained what he needed, and proceeded on his voyage. He gave names to
islands, bays, straits, and harbors, some of which seem strange at the
present day, but most of them were suggested by the circumstances of
the visit. Of many of the islands he took possession in the name of
his sovereign, leaving memorials of his landing.</p>

<p>Sailing to the westward, he examined the east coast of New Holland, as
it was then called, Australia, at the present time, charted the coast,
as he had done throughout the voyage, and took possession of the
country in the name of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> England. The existence of a Southern
Continent had long been a mooted question, and in this and subsequent
voyages Captain Cook searched unsuccessfully for it. He passed through
Torres Strait, and thus proved that New Guinea was not a part of
Australia, as some claimed. Continuing his voyage, he went around the
Cape of Good Hope, and reached England in the middle of 1771. The
results of his cruise of nearly four years were exceedingly important
to his country. His reputation was largely increased, and he was
promoted to the rank of commander in the navy.</p>

<p>So well approved was the conduct of Captain Cook on his first voyage
around the world, that he was appointed to the command of another
similar expedition, consisting of two ships, the Resolution and the
Adventure, and after about a year on shore, he sailed again in 1772.
He went around the Cape of Good Hope, and cruised in the Southern
Pacific, discovering and taking possession of New Caledonia, visiting
islands where he had landed before, and exploring and charting the New
Hebrides. His instructions particularly required him to circumnavigate
the earth in the highest practicable southern latitude in search of
the unknown continent still supposed to be there. He used the southern
summer for this purpose; but he found no land he was willing to call a
continent. Though large bodies of land have since been discovered in
that region, the question is still an open one.</p>

<p>Adapting his operations to the varying climate of the north and the
south, Captain Cook continued his explorations, encountering many
hardships and perils in unknown seas, from hostile savages, and in the
icy realms of the extreme south.</p>

<p>He returned to England in 1775 after an absence of three years. The
commander had always taken excellent care of the health of his men,
for in voyages of the description he had undertaken the mortality was
always considerable, and sometimes terrible. One of the most
noticeable features of his second expedition was that it returned with
a record of only one death in both ships; and the details of the means
he used to secure a good sanitary condition among his crews are very
interesting.</p>

<p>On his return Cook was immediately raised to the rank of post-captain,
and was also appointed a captain in Greenwich Hospital, which secured
to him an honorable retirement, and reward for his important labors.
He was elected a member of the Royal Society, which also bestowed upon
him a gold medal in recognition of his contributions to the science of
the period. The passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific by the north
coast of America was exciting a great deal of attention at this time,
and Captain Cook was sent upon an expedition to continue his
explorations in the Pacific, and then to investigate the mystery of a
northwest passage. He sailed in the Resolution in 1776, and was
followed by Captain Clerke in the Discovery. He proceeded, after his
arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, to Tasmania, visited New Zealand
again, and passed the following year in explorations in the Pacific.</p>

<img src="images/img070.jpg" width="600" height="436" alt="" title="">
<p>Death of Captain Cook.</p></div>

<p>In the first month of 1778 he discovered the Sandwich Islands, to
which he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span> gave this name in honor of his patron, the Earl
of Sandwich, then the first Lord of the Admiralty. Obtaining the
supplies he needed, the commander proceeded to explore the northwest
coast of America, which he followed inside of Behring Strait, till the
ice and cold compelled him to seek a more southern latitude, which he
found in the genial airs of the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>During his former visit he had found the natives to be friendly and
generally well disposed, though more addicted to thieving than the
people of any other islands the explorer had visited. For some
unexplained reason they were in a different frame of mind on his
second visit. A boat belonging to the expedition had been stolen by
the savages, and Captain Cook proceeded, in his usual vigorous manner,
to recover it. He sent a boat on shore for this purpose, and then
landed himself with another party, intending to capture a certain
chief, to be exchanged for the boat. An immense crowd gathered around
him, and were hypocritically friendly at first; but it was soon
observed that they were arming themselves. The commander asked
Kariopoo, the chief he had selected, to go with him, and he made no
objection. The captain had ordered the marines to be drawn up on the
shore, and leading his prisoner by the hand he approached the boat,
the natives opening a passage for him.</p>

<p>The chief's family and friends interposed to save him, declaring that
he would be killed if he went on board of the ship. The captain
expostulated with them and the tumult increased. The lieutenant of
marines wanted to fire, but Cook refused the pet mission. The tumult
soon became a battle, and then he ordered his men to fire. As he was
trying to save his party he was struck with a club, which partially
stunned him, and then he was stabbed in the back of the neck by an
iron dagger. He fell into shallow water, and the savages threw
themselves upon him. A struggle ensued, and he was hauled on the beach
by his foes, where they stabbed him in turn in their barbarous rage.
His body lay on the beach, and it might have been recovered, but it
was not. Only a portion of his remains were obtained, and they were
buried at sea.</p>

<p>Thus perished Captain James Cook, and all England mourned him.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img071.jpg" width="250" height="277" alt="John Howard." title="">
</div>

<p>John Howard was born in Hackney, Middlesex County, England, September
2, 1726. The only existing record of this fact is the inscription upon
his monument in St. Paul's Cathedral, London. His parentage came
through a somewhat obscure family, his father being sometimes
mentioned as an upholsterer and sometimes as a merchant of moderate
means. Of his mother we know only her name&mdash;Chomley&mdash;and that she died
when her second child, and only son, was an infant. The father was a
strict, sturdy, honest, severe Puritan, the marks of whose character
ever remained on the character of the son.</p>

<p>The motherless boy seems to have passed unnoticed through the weary
days of a sickly childhood, and the usual martyrdom of the "dullest
boy in the school," under first one tutor and then another, to his
sixteenth year, when he left school and books, as he afterward
testifies, "not thoroughly knowing any one thing." How much does any
boy or girl thoroughly know of any one thing at sixteen? Surely not
enough to warrant his removal from school.</p>

<p>But not so reasoned the father of John Howard, for we find him at this
age apprenticing his only son to Alderman Newham, a wholesale grocer
on Watling Street, London.</p>

<p>That this was not a change made from pecuniary necessity is evidenced
by the liberal provision made for the boy. We are told that his father
paid £700 for his fee of apprenticeship, and provided him a separate
suite of apartments, a servant, and a pair of saddle-horses! The
inference is that young John's progress in school was not such as to
warrant his continuance at his books.</p>

<p>His letters and manuscripts still in existence reveal a lamentable
deficiency in orthography and the handling of the king's English.</p>

<p>Some of Howard's biographers attempt to attribute his methodical
businesslike habits in later life to the experience gained while in
the service of this wholesale grocer. But when we consider that his
stay was far less than one year, we <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> may fairly be allowed to
conclude that more was due to an inherited temperament for slow
methodical action.</p>

<p>Before reaching his seventeenth year, the death of his father released
him from the grocery business, for which he had evidently no
affection, and left him in possession of £7,000 in ready cash, beside
land, plate, house, etc.</p>

<p>This fortune was left under the management of guardians, it being his
father's wish that he should not control it until his twenty-fourth
year. But his course of life goes to show that he had wonderfully easy
trustees, as he immediately bought himself off the grocery business,
and made a long tour of the Continent for the benefit of his health.
Returning to England, he dropped into the little village of Stoke
Newington, a mere hamlet, where he had some possessions.</p>

<p>That a young man of wealth and free from all ties of family or
business, should have voluntarily chosen such a home, and been
contented to remain there, in a state of idle inactivity, for the
space of seven or eight years, can be accounted for only by
remembering his feeble health.</p>

<p>When twenty-five, his health entirely failed, and he was prostrated by
a severe fit of illness, through which he was nursed by his landlady,
Mrs. Loidore. Upon his recovery he made her his wife, in testimony of
his gratitude, though history records that she had neither beauty,
money, nor health, having been an invalid for twenty-two years, and
was twenty-seven years his senior.</p>

<p>Two or three years after this seemingly ill-suited marriage, which,
strange to say, seems to have been a not unhappy one, Mrs. Howard
died. Immediately Mr. Howard, then twenty-eight or nine years of age,
again left England for a second extended tour. This being the year of
the great earthquake of Lisbon, he naturally turned his steps
thitherward.</p>

<p>Setting sail from England for Spain, he was captured on the high seas
by a French privateer, and for two months suffered the hardships and
indignities of prison life in those times. Upon his release he used
all his influence to secure the exchange of the remainder of his
vessel's company, and was successful. This prison experience he never
forgot.</p>

<p>Three years later (1758) he married Henrietta Leeds, a lady of fine
character, and one to whom he was sincerely attached. Indeed, so
fearful was he that their married life might not be entirely without
jars, that he made a bargain with her, in advance of their marriage,
that on all disputed points the adjustment should be according to his
judgment. One is at a loss which member of a couple the most to
admire, the man who could make such a proposition, or the woman who
would bind herself with such bonds! But, like his first marriage, his
strange contract with his second wife seems to have led only to happy
results.</p>

<p>They settled in Cardington, upon the Howard estate, and for the next
seven years led the uneventful life of landed gentry of the times. The
husband and wife were united in their efforts to improve the morals
and general condition of their tenantry. Rightly believing that the
beginning of all reform was to improve the physical condition, Howard
spared no expense in rearing new cottages <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> upon new and
improved plans, held his tenants removable at will, and through their
improved conditions ruled over them with an almost despotic sway,
tempered and made bearable in that all his restrictions and
requirements were on the line of their temporal and spiritual
advancement.</p>

<p>How strange is the making of history! Had the gentle, loving,
well-governed, dependent Mrs. Howard lived on, this would no doubt
have been the continuation, the aim, and the end of John Howard's
life&mdash;to constantly advance and improve the interests and condition of
his tenantry, and to wisely govern and administer his estate. But it
was not so to be. The happy home must be broken up, and the man whom
God needed must, through the sting of his own sorrow, be sent out
again upon his wanderings to do the work reserved for him in the broad
field not of his own choosing. The birth of the only child, a son,
preceded the death of its mother by but a few days, and Howard was
again alone. To the end of his life he remained a sincere and constant
mourner for the wife to whom he owed the happiest, if not the most
useful, seven years of his life. It is said by some of his biographers
that he always kept the anniversary of her death as a solemn day of
fasting and prayer.</p>

<p>Come we now to the point in his career where, all unknown to himself,
Howard took up the work which was to startle the whole civilized
world, and place his name in the roll of those whose memories die not.</p>

<p>But first let us remember the son whose life began where his mother's
ended, and ended where it was well his mother had not lived to see it.</p>

<p>It would seem that the loss of his beloved wife and the sad
recollection of his own motherless unloved boyhood, would have made of
John Howard a tender and pitiful, as well as devoted father. Such was
not the case, if we may judge from the vehemence with which some of
his biographers deny the charges of undue severity to the infant, and
forgetfulness and neglect of the growing-up boy, and the silence of
others on the same subject.</p>

<p>The real truth probably was, so far as we can judge, that the man had
nothing in his stiff nature and puritanical education, certainly
nothing in his own early life, to make him respond to the
uninteresting helplessness of infancy.</p>

<p>So we find him doing his duty by the crying infant of a few months, in
a manner which would be amusing if it were not pathetic. He takes him
from the nurse, lays him across his knees, and sits unmoved and
unmovable until the tempest exhausts itself, and the child is silent
from exhaustion, when he hands him solemnly back to the nurse, and
feels that, by so much at least, has he cast out of the young child
the spice of Old Adam, which is the birthright of us all! A few such
experiences, we are told, and the child would at once cease its
struggles and be silent. One would surely think it would!</p>

<p>But the silent, lonely man, bereft of the loving companionship of the
gentle wife, who would so differently have soothed and silenced the
crying infant, could not long bear the solitude of his broken home,
and so began the years of wanderings, which lasted as long as his
life, and through which he seems so largely to have lost sight of his
young son at his most impressionable age, save to provide <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span>
for his material wants, and to some extent, also, his education. When
with him in later years he appears to have enjoyed his society, or at
least the evidences which he gave of implicit, unreasoning obedience,
illustrated by his remark, "I believe if I told the boy to put his
hand in the fire he would obey me."</p>

<p>At four the boy was put into a boarding-school, and the home was
broken up. The later glimpses which we get of his career are vague,
unsatisfactory, or decidedly bad, until the end came, and "Jack" was
incarcerated in a mad-house when but twenty-two, where his unfortunate
life went out after twelve years' confinement in a darkness that
darkened also the last years of his good, if injudicious, father, with
a sorrow beside which all common bereavements should seem like
blessings.</p>

<p>In 1769, then, we see the Cardington home broken up, the boy placed in
a boarding-school, and John Howard setting forth upon what to him was
but an aimless journey, in search of consolation, amid new scenes, for
the shattered fortunes of his home. He travelled over large portions
of Italy, and returned again to England, where in 1773 he was elected
High Sheriff of Bedford. No sooner had he entered upon the duties of
his office, than he was struck with the gross injustice of the
practices, especially as affecting those prisoners held for debt. Many
heads of families were held for months and years, not for the original
debt for which they were incarcerated, which in many cases had been
forgiven or paid, but for an accumulation of fees due to jailer and
divers other officers of the prison, who drew their salaries from this
source. Much astounded by such a state of things in a Christian land,
but supposing it to be a peculiarity of his own county, he made a
journey into some of the surrounding districts, to learn from them, if
possible, some better method. It but augmented his indignation and
distress to find their condition and methods worse even than at home,
since in some he actually found the fees wrung from these unhappy
prisoners to amount to so much that the office of jailer was sold to
the highest bidder, the sum paid for the position often amounting to
as much as £40 per annum.</p>

<p>On this tour Howard, now thoroughly awake on the subject, could not
but observe the miseries of the prisoners from other sources, besides
extortions. This might have been borne, but for the terrible crowding
of herds of men and women, without regard to age, sex, character, or
crime, into foul underground dungeons, damp, dark, unventilated, often
unwarmed, with insufficient and unfit food and clothing, without beds,
and many in chains. Such were the sights which met his gaze at every
turn, and moved his soul with shame for his country, and a slow but
deadly anger that, once kindled, died only with his life. Thoroughly
and systematically he continued his investigation of the jails and
prisons of England, until he had been over them all, which consumed
nearly a year's time (travel was a different matter a hundred years
ago, from now), and then made his report public, for which labor he
was called before the bar of the House of Commons and received the
thanks of that august body.</p>

<p>More satisfactory still, he had the pleasure of seeing two bills
passed, one making the office of jailer a salaried position, thereby
abolishing the whole <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span> iniquitous system of special fees from
prisoners, the other having reference to improvements in ventilation
and other sanitary matters.</p>

<p>The text of these bills he had printed in large bold type at his own
expense, and sent them to every jail and prison in England. A few
months later, being desirous of seeing whether or not the requirements
of the new laws were being put into execution, he made personal
inspection, riding by chaise or on horseback from city to city and
from town to town.</p>

<p>Toward the last of this year, 1774, Howard made his first and last
venture into the arena of political life. Being a man of strong, stern
political convictions, and feeling it his duty to stand by his
principles, he listened to the advice of friends, and made a stand for
the House of Commons. Fortunately for the world he was defeated by
<i>four votes</i>.</p>

<p>On such small hinges swing the doors of life. Had he been elected he
would doubtless have sunk out of sight and been forgotten, and his
great work would have been given to some other agent.</p>

<p>Though greatly disappointed at his failure, Howard's mind at once
returned to the question of prison reform, and his next journey led
him over Ireland and Scotland. The former he found worse and the
latter better than England.</p>

<p>Being desirous of publishing a book upon his investigations and their
results, he at the close of this year left England to examine the
prisons of France, Flanders, and Holland. It surprises us much to
learn that he found the prisons of Holland almost models, while France
is declared far in advance of England, although these were the days of
the Bastille! He also journeyed into Switzerland and again made a
survey of the jails of England and Wales. Feeling at last that he had
sufficient material he returned to England and began upon his book.
For eight months he labored incessantly upon this work, correcting
proofs, collating and arranging statistics, etc., although for the
literary part he was obliged to call in the assistance of some of his
learned friends, who, better than he understood the use of the king's
English.</p>

<p>This book made a most profound sensation throughout the civilized
world. That it might reach a more extended circulation, it was sold at
less than the cost of production, and large numbers were given away
among the officials. All this expense was borne by Howard out of his
own private purse, as were at all times his immense and constant
outlay in travel. Not only his whole private income, but the fortune
of £15,000 received from his only sister at her death, was expended in
the same manner.</p>

<p>Subsequently Howard published a second volume, in 1780, as an appendix
to the first, and in 1784 a third and last, which was a compilation of
the first two, with much added material acquired during his continuous
travels over every part of Europe.</p>

<p>Howard relieving a Prisoner.</p></div>

<p>During the earlier and idler parts of his life, Howard had been
pleased to dabble somewhat in medicine, after the manner of the
gentlemen of his time. This stood him in good part upon his travels,
and made him familiar with the various forms of disease that
especially afflicted prisons and the people at large. For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span>
jail fever and typhus he rightly judged that the sanitary and food
conditions were sufficient cause and attacked them from this basis.
But having in a measure finished his jail and prison work, to his
mind, he became possessed with the idea that he might search out and
find a remedy for the dreadful <i>plague</i> that was filling all Europe
with dismay. The methodical habit of the man's mind is evidenced by
noting that he followed exactly the same method in this as in his
former undertaking, namely, personal investigation and experience. He
left home in July, 1789, and it is surprising that for six months he
literally lived in the poisonous atmosphere of the pest-houses,
pest-ships, and lazarettos of Europe, and escaped contagion. In
January, 1790, however, in a little Russian village near the Crimea,
he was called upon to prescribe for a young lady, ill with some low
malignant fever, from which visit he contracted the same disease.
Being then sixty-four years of age, naturally frail, worn down by
sixteen years of hard, exhaustive toil, depleted by a diet that found
no place for meats or stimulants, he had nothing upon which to rally,
and rapidly sank into the long slumber which at last gave him what he
had so many years denied himself&mdash;<i>rest</i>.</p>

<p>His remains were buried there in Russia in the village of Dophinovka.
After his death a monument was erected to his memory, being the first
placed in St. Paul's Cathedral, London. This was appropriately
inscribed to his memory, although it was his latest expressed wish
that he should be left to sleep in an unmarked, unknown grave.</p>

<p>A just estimate of the character of John Howard can only be arrived at
by a careful consideration of the times in which he lived and the
peculiar circumstances of his life. The natural inherited sternness of
his character never felt the modifying influences of a mother's love
or the companionship of brothers or sisters. His ill health added to
his restless desire for travel and change, but unfitted him for close
or continued application to any special line of thought or interest,
while his early independence in the management of his fortune placed
in his way strong temptations to extravagance and idleness.</p>

<p>It is therefore more than an ordinary indication of an inborn
principle of humanity when we find him, upon his first settlement upon
his father's estates, devoting time, thought, and money to the
amelioration of the condition of his neglected and suffering tenantry.
Model landlords were not in fashion in those times, and a man who so
administered his affairs must have done so in the face of much
criticism, ridicule, and contempt among his peers.</p>

<p>But none of these things seem to have moved him from the even tenor of
his way. Yet there was no sentimentalism in his dealings with his
tenants, as we find him holding them to a strict accounting for the
use made of their improved conditions.</p>

<p>So of his prison work. It seemed to be all and altogether for the
masses, and not for individuals. No record is left of personal
almsgiving, save when resorted to as a ruse to obtain entrance to the
French prisons. That his interest was not in individuals is further
shown by the calm and deliberate manner in which he prosecuted his
investigations, taking years for the accumulation of materials
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> and months to their careful watching through the press. It
was the principle of justice ingrained in the man's deepest nature
that forced him to <i>know</i> all that could be known or said upon both
sides before speaking. It was this thoroughness, this absolute
fairness, that made of his work and of his inartistically constructed
books the tremendous and lasting success which they were.</p>

<p>Deeply religious, he naturally reflected the spirit of the religious
teachings of the times, which savored more of the terrors of the law
than of mercy and forgiveness to evil-doers; that found more worship
in denying self the indulgences of soft living than in the partaking
of the harmless pleasures and sweets of life, giving a good God thanks
for His good gifts. Through all the life and writings of Howard one
constantly hears the minor chord of infinite sadness wrought into his
life by his motherless infancy, his unloved boyhood, his years of
invalidism, his ceaseless mourning for his wife Henrietta, the
bitterness of death in the cup held to his lips by his unfortunate
son, and over and above all, the constant atmosphere of crime,
cruelty, sin, and suffering in which he spent the last sixteen years
of his life. Life to him came to mean sin, suffering, and sorrow in
the world about him, and for himself work, work, incessant work, in
the effort to do what one man could to lift or lighten the burden
under which the whole earth groaned. Death came to him where he would
have most wished it might, and took him directly from labor to reward.
And throughout the coming ages the world will be the better because in
the last half of the eighteenth century there lived, labored, and died
in the midst of his labors one <i>John Howard, the Philanthropist</i>.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>Was Ethan Allen a hero or a humbug? a patriot or a pretender? Ask
Vermont and she cries "Nulli secundus!" Ask New York and the reply is
"Ad referendum."</p>

<p>The differentiation antedates the American Revolution and the part
Ethan Allen played in that historic drama. It is an inheritance of
loving loyalty and gratitude that quivers in the answer of one State,
the traditional antagonisms of prejudice that speak in the other.</p>

<p>But for Ethan Allen, Vermont would have had no separate existence. But
for Ethan Allen, New York's northeastern boundary would have been the
Connecticut River. Therefore, on one shore of Lake Champlain the
disputed shield <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> is unalloyed gold, reflecting all that is
strong and brave, all that is courageous and magnanimous, all that is
patriotic and generous, while from the other shore its appearance is
as brass engraven by vanity and vulgarity, by self-sufficiency and
infidelity.</p>

<a id="img073" name="img073"></a>

</div>

<p>Controversy over property rights engenders such diversities of
opinion, and when, as in this case, one side gains all and the other
loses much, the exultation of triumph or the bitterness of defeat will
color the ink of all literature on the subject for a century to come.</p>

<p>Not until after the year 1761 did the dense wilderness of either
Northern New York, or what was then considered Western New Hampshire,
prove attractive to the Yankee or Dutch settler in search of a pioneer
home. The cruel conflicts that for over seventy years had made these
border lands the scene of bloody race enmities were ended by the
conquest of Canada. These primeval forests, that had echoed only to
the tread of skulking savages, or the revengeful tramp of opposing
forces, became peaceful spots for the erection of hearth-stones around
which women and children might gather in safety. Many of the
Connecticut soldiery who had taken active part in the late French and
Indian wars, now recalled the beautiful country through which they had
marched to meet or pursue the foe, the grandeur of its evergreen
mountain peaks, the limpid sheets of water nestling between, its
sparkling fish-laden streams, and the apparent fertility of its soil.</p>

<p>These recollections were stimulated by the conditions which confronted
them on their return to peaceful and agricultural pursuits. The
subdivision of farms among the many robust sons of the average New
England household had reached its limit, and the young man who would
found a home and family of his own, thenceforth must seek for cheaper
and broader acres than were to be found already under cultivation. New
Hampshire's liberal offer of grants in her western border upon easy
terms, decided the future of many a New England lad, and for several
years the tide of emigration rolled steadily northward.</p>

<p>From Burlington, on Lake Champlain, for one hundred miles south to
Bennington, the sound of the axe was heard by day and by night. The
enthusiasms of a new country lent strength to the arm and courage to
the heart. In every direction homes sprang up, surrounded by young
orchards, and beyond and around these, cultivated fields.</p>

<p>Suddenly the settlers were set to wondering and worrying at the sight
of strange surveyors taking new measurements through the farms
wrenched from the wilds with so much of hard labor and wearisome toil.
And then the blow fell. New York was claiming all this tract of land
as part of her province, and declaring New Hampshire grants to be null
and void. A second payment for their farms was demanded, based upon
their present value as improved property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> In some cases new owners put in an appearance and attempted
to take possession, having purchased, in good faith, of land
speculators in New York City, to whom Governor Colden, of New York,
had issued immense grants covering a large part of the disputed
territory. These speculators were mostly lawyers, who were favorites
or friends of the governor. Against these shrewd men of wealth and
education, with their powerful backing, the puny defence of the
original settlers seemed wellnigh hopeless. But it was to be a contest
between might and right, and that invisible influence which seems ever
to weaken the one and strengthen the other was surely, though silently
at work.</p>

<p>Upon this scene of trouble and uncertainty appears Ethan Allen, a
farmer, born about thirty years before in Coventry, Conn., large of
frame, of great personal strength, and with mental characteristics in
harmony with his powerful physique: a tender-hearted giant whose
standard of honor and honesty soon measured the injustice of New
York's position in the land controversy, and at once sided with the
besieged farmers, with whom he had many generalities of sympathy.</p>

<p>With fiery energy of will and purpose, he immediately assumed the
leadership of the defence, guiding its combined strength into the
legal side of the question, thus meeting the power of alleged law with
like weapons. Selecting the best legal talent of Connecticut as
assistants, and armed with New Hampshire's charter and seal, he
appeared in the Albany courts to contest New York's claim that the
Connecticut River was the boundary between that province and New
Hampshire.</p>

<p>But the trial was a farce, stripped of all dignity and justice by the
fact that the judge upon the bench, the prosecuting attorneys, and
other officials were personally interested, each holding New York
grants for many thousand acres in the disputed territory. All evidence
for the defence, even the New Hampshire charter, was ruled out of
court, and Ethan Allen's peaceful efforts for defence were defeated.</p>

<p>He returned home, burning with indignation and resolving to protect
his property and that of his neighbors, if need were, by the force of
his own strong right arm. For six years, under his leadership, all
attempts by New York settlers to take possession were frustrated by
the alertness of the "Green Mountain Boys," as the defence now termed
themselves, who drove them off quietly or with violence, according to
the exigencies of the occasion.</p>

<p>As a measure of punishment for these acts, Ethan Allen was outlawed by
the Governor of New York, and a price offered for his capture. Soon
after he rode alone into Albany one day, and alighting at a tavern in
the heart of the city, called for refreshment. His former visit had
marked his strong personality in the remembrance of many, and he was
at once recognized by prominent officials, who stared at him with
curiosity, but made no effort to arrest him. Returning their gaze, he
lifted his glass to his lips, pledging in a loud, firm voice "The
Green Mountain Boys," and then rode away unmolested.</p>

<p>This act was defined by his friends as the rashness of bravery; by his
enemies as the madness of impudence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> But the cloud overhanging the shores of Lake Champlain was
but a shadow compared with the darkness of the storm brooding over the
whole region south and east of it, and the battle of Lexington ended
this local strife.</p>

<p>Thenceforth, Ethan Allen was to bid defiance, not to a State, but to a
nation. To him and his Green Mountain Boys came urgent appeals from
leading patriots of the American Revolution for help and support in
the coming struggle, and the answer was more than kindly assent and
promise: it was prompt and vigorous action&mdash;the first aggressive blow
at the power of Great Britain, for the musket-shots that harassed the
retreating red-coats from Concord were those of spirited defence
rather than of deliberate attack.</p>

<p>As the fortress of Ticonderoga had been the key of the position in the
late French and Indian wars, the gain or loss of which meant either
overwhelming victory or disaster, so now it was deemed of equal
importance in the coming conflict, which inevitably would bring the
British foe upon them from the North, along the same familiar
war-path. The capture of this fort was a serious undertaking, for it
was well garrisoned by a company of British soldiers, and thoroughly
equipped for vigorous defense. Only the keenest strategy and the most
complete surprise would avail in the accomplishment of the task.</p>

<p>But the experience and ability of Ethan Allen&mdash;who had been
unanimously chosen as leader&mdash;was adequate to the occasion, and his
plans were made with the greatest secrecy and skill. One of his men
was detailed to gain admission to the fort on some pretext, and then
by skilfully acting the part of a greenhorn full of foolish questions,
to learn many important facts and necessary details. In addition, a
lad was found thoroughly familiar with the interior of the garrison,
who would serve as guide, and on the night of May 9, 1775, 270
American patriots appeared on the shore opposite Fort Ticonderoga,
which was on the west or New York side of Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>A day or two previous a small force of men had been despatched
secretly to points above and below this spot in quest of boats, which
failing them, in this emergency only 83 of the 270 men could be
accommodated in the limited number at hand. Spring lingers long in
this latitude, and the night, clear and cold, was giving way to dawn
when the brave leader and his little vanguard of heroes resolved to
attack without further re-enforcement. According to military precedent,
he first harangued his followers.</p>

<p>"Friends and fellow-soldiers, you have for a number of years been a
scourge and a terror to arbitrary power. Your valor has been famed
abroad and acknowledged, as appears by the advice and orders to me
from the General Assembly of Connecticut to surprise and take the
garrison now before us. I now propose to advance before you and in
person conduct you through the wicket gate; for we must this morning
either quit our pretensions to valor, or possess ourselves of this
fortress in a few minutes. And inasmuch as it is a desperate attempt,
which none but the bravest men dare undertake, I do not urge it on any
contrary to his will. You that will undertake voluntarily, poise your
firelock!"</p>

<p>Needless to state, the firelocks were all "poised"&mdash;whatever that may
be&mdash;and, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> led by Allen, a rush was made, the sentry
overpowered, and soon the gallant "83" were standing back to back on
the parade-ground within the fort, their muskets levelled at the two
barracks which, filled with sleeping soldiers, faced each other.</p>

<p>The commandant was then aroused by loud rapping on his door and the
voice of Allen bidding him come out and surrender the fort. The
astonished officer, half dressed, made his appearance, demanding by
what authority he was asked to do such a thing.</p>

<p>A part of Ethan Allen's famous reply: "In the name of Jehovah and the
Continental Congress!" was more prophetic than authentic, as the
latter earthly tribunal at that time had no existence.</p>

<p>The hundred cannon and quantities of ammunition found in the fort were
sent east, where they proved of great service in the siege of Boston.</p>

<p>Crown Point, the garrison of St. Johns, many boats, vessels, and a
British armed schooner soon after fell into the hands of the Green
Mountain Boys, thus giving them the full sweep of Lake Champlain, and
holding in check any attempts at invasion from that direction.</p>

<p>Ethan Allen's military instincts and foresight transcended any
experience and all knowledge he possessed on the subject. He at once
saw the importance of pushing the advantage now gained, by an
immediate advance upon Canada before reinforcements could arrive to
strengthen the strongholds of Montreal and Quebec; a measure which, if
adopted, would have changed the whole history of the northern campaign
that eventually proved so disastrous.</p>

<p>With the splendid magnanimity of a noble soul and the abnegation of a
true patriot, he addressed the Continental Congress of New York on the
subject, first apologizing for his seeming neglect to consult with
that body before his attack on Ticonderoga, which was within its
province, and explaining the necessity for secrecy, which prompted
him. Note the spirit of prophecy breathed in the following words:</p>

<p>"I wish to God America would at this critical juncture exert herself
agreeable to the indignity offered her by a tyrannical ministry. She
might rise on eagle's wings and mount up to glory, freedom, and
immortal honor if she did but know and exert her strength. Fame is now
hovering over her head. A vast continent must now sink to slavery,
poverty, and bondage, or rise to unconquerable freedom, immense
wealth, inexpressible felicity, and immortal fame."</p>

<p>He then offers the services of his own men for the purpose, and to
raise a regiment of rangers in Northern New York, a proposal which he
trusts will not be deemed impertinent.</p>

<p>Ethan Allen at Ticonderoga.</p></div>

<p>But for some unexplained reason no action was taken on his suggestions
until months later, when the conditions had materially changed, making
such a campaign exceedingly more difficult. Generals Schuyler and
Montgomery were then in command, and to Ethan Allen was given a task
requiring shrewdness, tact, and great personal influence&mdash;to enlist
the co-operation or the neutrality of the Canadians in the struggle
between the American colonists and the mother country. For weeks he
travelled in Canada, "preaching politics" so successfully <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span>
that he was able to report a company of 300 Canadian recruits for the
American service, and that 2,000 more could be enlisted when needed.</p>

<p>In returning from this expedition he was persuaded by a brother
officer into a step that but for an accident would have been more
brilliant than Allen's former exploit and added fresh laurels to his
name as a military hero. It was no less than the surprise and capture
of Fort Montreal, then garrisoned by 500 men, 40 only of whom were
regulars, the remainder volunteers and Indians.</p>

<p>It seemed a feasible undertaking. The plan was similar to the seizure
of Ticonderoga&mdash;the quiet landing of boats under the walls of the fort
before daybreak and the quick rush of attack. The forces were divided,
Allen taking 110 men and landing below the city. The remainder and
larger portion were to cross the river above and then signal the
others. Colonel Allen promptly performed his part of the programme,
but no signal greeted his ears, and daylight found him in full view of
the fort and unable to retreat. He and his men for two hours bravely
resisted the enemy, who sallied out to attack them, but without avail,
and they were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>The story of Ethan Allen's long captivity, lasting two years and eight
months, as told by himself, is one of the most interesting narratives
connected with the Revolutionary war. Loaded with chains, consigned to
the filthy hold of a vessel, with no seat nor bed save a seaman's
chest, half starved, tortured by daily indignities, his high courage
and brave spirit never faltered. Once, when insulted, he sprang at his
tormentor&mdash;the captain of the ship&mdash;and with his shackled hands
knocked him down; and again he bit off the nail that fastened his
handcuffs, and by these feats of strength and anger awed his guards
into some show of respect.</p>

<p>The method by which he saved himself from a felon's death in England
was worthy the dignity of a veteran diplomat. A letter to the
Continental Congress, which he knew would never reach its destination,
but fall into the hands of its bitterest enemy, Lord North, contained
an account of his ill treatment and possible fate, and closed with the
request that if retaliation upon the Tory and other prisoners in its
power should be found necessary, it might be exercised not according
to his own value or rank, but in proportion to the importance of the
cause for which he suffered.</p>

<p>The English ministry concluded evidently to treat him henceforth as a
prisoner of war entitled to an honorable exchange, rather than a rebel
deserving an ignoble death, and he was returned to America, where he
was confined, with varieties of usage, in Halifax, and afterward in
New York.</p>

<p>While in the latter place, and suffering from hunger and long ill
health, he was approached by a British officer, authorized to offer
him the command of a royalist regiment, and the gift of thousands of
acres of land at the close of the war, in any part of the American
colonies he might select, providing he would forsake the patriot cause
and take oath of allegiance to the crown. Colonel Allen rejected this
overture with great scorn, assuring the officer that he had as little
land to promise him as had the devil when making a similar one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> "Thereupon," said Allen, "he closed the conversation and
turned from me with an air of dislike, saying I was a bigot."</p>

<p>An exchange of prisoners at length freed him from a situation so full
of personal hardship and mental anguish, and he hastened home to his
family, from whom he so long and cruelly had been separated.</p>

<p>His only son had died in the meantime, and his wife and daughters, not
expecting his arrival, were not at Bennington in time to receive him.
But his neighbors and friends flocked in from miles around to give him
greeting, and although it was the Sabbath, a day strictly observed in
those parts, the enthusiasm of the joyful occasion could neither be
postponed nor suppressed, and its expression found vent in the firing
of cannon and happy huzzas.</p>

<p>The "Hampshire Grants" in his absence had become the full-fledged
"State of Vermont," knocking for admission at the doors of the
Continental Congress.</p>

<p>Ethan Allen at once was appointed General of the Vermont State
Militia, and although he did not again join the American army, his
natural gifts of diplomacy were of inestimable service to the country,
and the number of men he could summon at a moment's notice to his
command, served to hold in check any attempted raids of the enemy
through Canada. He lived eight years after the declaration of peace,
dying at the age of fifty-one, in Burlington, where he was engaged in
farming.</p>

<p>A little incident never before in print was recently related to the
writer of this sketch by a lady to whom it was told in childhood by an
old man who, as a lad, lived on Ethan Allen's farm. It was in
illustration of the simplicity of the celebrated hero's private life.</p>

<p>The farm hands all sat at the table with the family, much to the
amusement or astonishment of his frequent guests, who sometimes were
wealthy and distinguished and quite unaccustomed to such practical
exhibitions of democracy. One of these had the poor taste to
expostulate with the general, and remarked, "I should think your men
would prefer to eat by themselves."</p>

<p>General Allen feigned to misunderstand the meaning of this, and after
a moment's reflection replied, "Thank you very much for calling my
attention to it. I see that what has been hearty enough for my family
may not have been for my hard-working help. I will take more notice
hereafter to see that they are better served."</p>

<p>"It was little use," says my informant, "to try to dictate to Ethan
Allen."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>
